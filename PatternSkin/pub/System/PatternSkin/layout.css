As this #patternWrapper is inside the #patternPage which is 100% height, moz will not inherit heights further into the design inside this container, which you should be able to do with use of the min-height style. Instead, Mozilla ignores the height:100% or min-height:100% from this point inwards to the center of the design - a nasty bug.
If you change this to height:100% moz won't expand the design if content grows.
