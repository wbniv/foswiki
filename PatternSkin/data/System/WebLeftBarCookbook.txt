*Instructions and tips how to use WebLeftBarPersonalTemplate*.

!WebLeftBarPersonalTemplate is a topic template to create a personal left bar block for each user. The personal topic, &lt;user&gt;LeftBar is included in the left bar. Its contents are only visible to you. You may put there whatever suits you - links to frequently visited topics, or a dynamically generated list of topics.

Each link is an item in a bullet list. So it can look like this:

   * *My links*
      * WebHome
      * WebIndex
      * WebChanges

(or use your own personal topics).

The list is formatted with CSS. To get an idea of the actual look, see the list above formatted as in the left bar (you need to have =SKIN= set to PatternSkin):

<div class="patternSideBar" style="position:relative; top:0; left:0; padding:0; margin:0; border:0;">
<div class="patternLeftBarPersonal">
   * *My links*
      * WebHome
      * WebIndex
      * WebChanges
</div> 
</div>

By default the &lt;user&gt;LeftBar topic has an edit link. In case you loose the edit link line of text, here's a copy:
<verbatim>
<div class="twikiSmall"><a href="%SCRIPTURLPATH{"edit"}%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%?t=%GMTIME{"$year$mo$day$hours$minutes$seconds"}%">edit</a></div>
</verbatim>
