---++ Summary of Contents

This module supports structured queries over a database built on the fly from
the forms in TWiki topics. It does not support any tags, as it is provided as a
service for other plugins that want to treat a TWiki web as a simple database;
for example, the TWiki:Plugins/FormQueryPlugin, which supports the display of
query results.

The plugin encapsulates code that was formerly in the "engine room" of the
<nop>FormQueryPlugin. It has been abstracted out in the belief that it will be
useful to anyone who wants to do simple search operations from a plugin.

---+++ Features
	* Perform complex queries on the TWiki database
	* Cache TWiki topics for rapid queries

---+++ How the database gets built
You can think of the database as an array of all the topics in a web. Each
array entry is a map (or hash in perl terms) that maps a set of field names to
values.

Each topic in the web automatically gets a number of standard fields, generated
by reading the metadata from the topic (see %SYSTEMWEB%.TWikiMetaData)
	* =name=        - name of the topic
	* =parent=      - name of parent topic
	* =_up=         - _reference_ to the Map of the parent topic, if it exists
	* =attachments= - array of Maps, each of which contains:
		*  =_up= - _reference_ to the Map for the topic
		*  =name= - attachment name
		* =attr= - e.g hidden
		* =comment= - attachment comment
		* =path= - client path used to upload attachment
		* =size= - size in Kb
		* =user= - who uploaded the attachment
		* =version= - e.g. 1.3
	* =info= - Map containing:
		* =_up= - reference to the Map for the topic
		* =author= - most recent author
		* =date= - date of last change
		* =format= - topic format version
		* =version= - topic version number
	* =moved= - Map containing:
		* =_up= - reference to the Map for the topic
		* =by= - who moved it
		* =date= - when they moved it
		* =from= - where they moved it from
		* =to= - where they moved it to
	* =form= - form type
	*  _form name_ - e.g. if a "My<nop>Form" is attached, this will be
          =My<nop>Form=. This is a reference to a Map containing a key for each
          field in the form. Each key maps to the value in the form data for
          that key. The Map will also have an =_up= reference to the Map for
          the topic.
	* =text= - raw text of the topic)

The sub-Maps created for =info=, _form name_, =moved=, and each row in
=attachments= also have a _reference_ back to the topic Map, called  =_up=.

Other fields may be added by subclasses. Refer to the documentation for the
plugin that is using the DBCache for more details.

---+++ The cache
To achieve best perfomance the plugin caches the database read from the TWiki
topics. The cache is stored in the work area for the DBCacheContrib (see
={RCS}{WorkAreaDir}= in =configure=). If any topic changes in the web, this
cache is automatically rebuilt. The cache file can be deleted at any point with
no ill effects.

---+++ Extending or customising
Extension or customisation is welcome, as long as all extensions are described
and code provided back to the author.

The module is shipped with a perl build file, which should be used for
installation and testing. Testing is done using CPAN:Test::Unit, and is invoked
using the 'test' build target. Writing tests is a useful way of feeding back
bugs as well. I can't encourage you enough to maintain and extend the tests!

---++ Detailed Documentation
Clients use the DBCache by defining a subclass of the
=TWiki::Contrib::DBCacheContrib= class. The following POD documentation
describes the methods of this class and the various other classes provided by
the plugin..

---++ Installation Instructions
<strong>
WARNING: TWiki-4 only. If you want to use this extension with an earlier
version of TWiki, please see
[[http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Plugins/%TOPIC%?rev=1.9][an earlier version of this topic]]
</strong>

<div class="twikiAlert">
Note: if you are upgrading from a pre-13527 version, you __must__ run
=configure= after you have installed. Specifically, the
={DBCacheContrib}{Archivist}= configuration option must have a value, or you
will get a "No {DBCacheContrib}{Archivist}" error.
</div>

---+++ {DBCache}{AlwaysUpdateCache}
If  $TWiki::cfg{DBCache}{AlwaysUpdateCache}  is set to FALSE (defaults to TRUE
for compatibility) then <nop>DBCacheContrib will avoid calling =_updateCache= unless
requested. =_updateCache= accesses every topic file in the
web, so its an unnecessary performance hit.  <nop>DBCacePlugin now only requests
=_updateCache= from the afterSaveHandler and from the new REST updateCache
handler.
