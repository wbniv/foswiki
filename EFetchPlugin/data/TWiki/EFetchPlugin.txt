---+ <nop>%TOPIC%
This plugin allows the user to display the abstract for a given <nop>PubMed ID.  This is accomplished by either displaying the desired information on the current page or by displaying a link to the desired information on [[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi][PubMed]].  The plugin utilizes EFetch, provided by Entrez.  For more information, visit [[http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query/static/eutils_help.html][Entrez programming utilities]].

---++ Syntax Rules

	* There is one way to display the abstract for a given <nop>PubMed ID.  In the example "number" is the desired <nop>PubMed ID.
		1 &#37;PMID{number}%
	* There are three methods for calling the <nop>%TOPIC% plugin to display a link to <nop>PubMed.  In the following examples, "number" is the desired <nop>PubMed ID (an 8-digit number) and "link text" is the desired text to display for the link.
		1 &#37;PMIDL{pmid="number" name="link text"}%
		1 &#37;PMIDL{number}%
		  %BR%This method defaults the link text to number.
		1 &#37;PMIDC{number}%
		  %BR%This method defaults the link text to the short citation provided by <nop>PubMed.

Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction autograft choice: bone-tendon-bone
versus hamstring: does it really matter? A systematic review.

Anterior cruciate ligament graft choice is controversial, with no evidence-based
consensus available to guide decision making. The study design was
evidence-based medicine systematic review of randomized controlled trials
evaluating patellar tendon versus hamstring tendon autografts. A literature
review identified 9 randomized controlled trials comparing patellar tendon and
hamstring tendon autografts. An evidence-based systematic review was performed.
Objective and subjective outcomes of interest included surgical technique,
rehabilitation, instrumented laxity, isokinetic strength, patellofemoral pain,
return to preinjury activity, and Tegner, Lysholm, Cincinnati, and International
Knee Documentation Committee-1991 scores. Additional surgery, graft failure, and
complications were reviewed. Slight increased laxity on arthrometer testing was
seen in the hamstring population in 3 of 7 studies. Pain with kneeling was
greater for the patellar tendon population in 4 of 4 studies. Only 1 of 9
studies showed increased anterior knee pain in the patellar tendon group.
Frequency of additional surgery seemed to be related to the fixation method and
not graft type. No study reported a significant difference in graft failure
between patellar tendon and hamstring tendon autografts. Objective differences
(range of motion, isokinetic strength, arthrometer testing) were not detected
between groups in the majority of studies, suggesting that their sensitivity to
detect clinical outcomes may be limited. Increased kneeling pain in the patellar
tendon group was seen consistently in the studies evaluated. Subjective
differences in anterior knee pain or return-to-activity level were not
consistently observed in these studies. With numbers available, failure rates
were not significantly different between groups. These findings suggest that
graft type may not be the primary determinant for successful outcomes after
anterior cruciate ligament surgery.
