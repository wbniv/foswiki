---+ <nop>TouchGraph <nop>WikiBrowser Applet Instructions: 

---++ Graph Navigation
 
	* *%RED%Change locale%ENDCOLOR%*: *Double click* on a node to localize view to the node and its neighbors 
 
	* *%RED%Go to page%ENDCOLOR%*: Click on a node to show the associated link in the browser window.
		* %MAROON%Brown%ENDCOLOR% nodes link to %MAROON%topics%ENDCOLOR% in the current web,
		* %PURPLE%purple nodes%ENDCOLOR% link to %PURPLE%external pages%ENDCOLOR% and wiki topics in different webs.
 
	<!-- * *Show node info*: Hover over a node to show the corresponding URL in the status bar of the hypertext panel. -->
	* *%RED%Expand node%ENDCOLOR%*: *Right click* on a node and select _Expand Node_ to show all of it's neighbors.
	* *%RED%Collapse node%ENDCOLOR%*: *Right click* on a node and select _Collapse Node_ to hide neighbors that can't be reached from any other node.
	* *%RED%Hide node%ENDCOLOR%*: *Right click* on a node and select _Hide Node_ to hide the node and it's neighbors that can only be reached from that node.%BR% *%RED%Note%ENDCOLOR%*:  For graphs where the central node has a lot of neighbors, hide the central node to see the relationships between the neighbors independent of the central node. 

---++ Toolbar
 
	<!-- Back Button: Click back button to go to a previously selected node, displaying the associated wiki page in the browser window. -->

	* *E#*: E# refers to the edge degree of a node. This is the sum on the incoming and outgoing edges. Do not confuse E# with the %RED%little red numbers%ENDCOLOR% at the upper right of the node labels. These numbers indicate the number of edges (incoming and outgoing) *not* shown.
 
	* *Show E#*: A node whose edge degree is greater than this number will not be shown. This number should be greater than _Expand E#_, because it is more restrictive then the _Expand E#_ constraint.
 
	* *Expand E#*: A node whose edge degree is greater than this number will be shown but not expanded. Thus if a node having an edge degree of greater than _Expand E#_ is located at radius 1 from the focus node, and the radius is set to 2, then the nodes at radius 2 that can only be reached through the offending node will not be shown.
 
	* *Radius*: The locality radius: when one chooses a focus node by double clicking on it, the size of the displayed region will be determined by the Radius. The resulting graph will consist of nodes that can be reached by following _radius_ edges away from the focus node.%BR% *%RED%Note%ENDCOLOR%*: _Radius_, _Show <nop>BackLinks_, and the _E#_ combos will only work if some node is selected.
 
	* *Show <nop>BackLinks*: If _Show <nop>BackLinks_ is not checked, then the corresponding graph will be generated by recursively following only outgoing hyperlinks from the focus node. Selecting the _Show <nop>BackLinks_ option will show the nodes which link to the focus node, not just the nodes from which the focus node can be reached.%BR% *%RED%Note%ENDCOLOR%*: It is good to select the _Show <nop>BackLinks_ option if you are lost towards the end of a branch (where few nodes are shown) and want to see more of the surrounding area. Selecting the _Show <nop>BackLinks_ option will cause a lot more nodes to be displayed so it will probably be necessary to choose lower values for the _Radius_ and _E#_ combo boxes. 
 
 
	* *Zoom Scroll Bar*: Zooming in is very useful for cluttered graphs. 

	* <img src="%ATTACHURL%/kill.png" alt=""/> *Stop Button*: Clicking this button serves two purposes. If the graph is moving erratically (which happens only if a node with too many outgoing edges has been expanded) then clicking the stop button will stop this motion. Click the button once to bring the graph to a slow stop, and twice to bring it to a complete halt. Clicking the stop button will also quickly wrap up the animation of new nodes, which initially appear as pale shapes, being added. 

---++ Search

Enter a search string in the search text field, and press enter (or click _Search_). An exact match will be found if it exists, otherwise the first node whose label contains the substring will be set as the focus node. Search is not case sensitive.
