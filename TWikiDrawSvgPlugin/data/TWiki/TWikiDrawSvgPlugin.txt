---++ <nop>%TOPIC%

This is a modification of the <nop>TWikiDrawPlugin which encapsulates the <nop>TWikiDraw Java Applet first developed by Main.PeterThoeny from the original <nop>JHotDraw.
Modifications are : 
	* the application is no more an Java Applet lanched by the browser but uses the Java(tm) <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/">Web Start</a> technology. That means the application no more depends of the web browser and could use java 1.3 or earlier.
	* the application also saves the image in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/"><nop>SVG</a> (extension .svg)
---++ Syntax Rules

	* Write the command =%<nop>DRAWINGSVG{name}%= anywhere in a TWiki topic. You can name the drawing anything you like, allowed characters are =A-Z a-z 0-9 _ - .= . If you have only one drawing in the topic you can simply write =%<nop>DRAWINGSVG%= .

---+++ Tools

The tools on the left create or manipulate figures.
| <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/SEL1.gif" width="24" height="24" alt="Selection"> | selects, moves or resizes a figure; the shift-key toggles the selection. Dragging the selection tool in the background selects the figures within the dragged rectangle. |
| <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/TEXT1.gif" width="24" height="24" alt="Text"> | creates a new or edits an existing text figure |
| <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ATEXT1.gif" width="24" height="24" alt="Connected Text"> | creates a new text figure and attaches it to the clicked figure. Once a text figure is attached it remains connected to the figure. |
| <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/RECT1.gif" width="24" height="24" alt="Rectangle"> | creates a rectangle figure |
| <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/RRECT1.gif" width="24" height="24" alt="Round Rectangle"> | creates a round rectangle figure |
| <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ELLIPSE1.gif" width="24" height="24" alt="Ellipse"> | creates an ellipse figure |
| <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/LINE1.gif" width="24" height="24" alt="Line"> | creates a line figure |
| <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/CONN1.gif" width="24" height="24" alt="Connection Line"> | creates or adjusts connections between figures. A connection is split into segments by dragging a point on the connection. To join two segments click the end point of a segment |
| <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/OCONN1.gif" width="24" height="24" alt="Elbow Connection Line"> | creates an elbow connection and offers the same features as the ordinary connection tool |
| <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/SCRIBBL1.gif" width="24" height="24" alt="Scribble"> | creates a scribble figure; dragging the mouse creates a smooth line while successive clicks yields a polyline figure. A two-button click terminates the figure. |
| <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/POLYGON1.gif" width="24" height="24" alt="Polygon"> | creates a polygon figure; dragging the mouse creates a smooth border while successive clicks yields a polyline border. A two-button click terminates the figure. |
| <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/BORDDEC1.gif" width="24" height="24" alt="Border"> | decorates the clicked figure with a border |

---+++ Handles

When selected, figures provide different handles to manipulate them.
	* the filled red handles enable you to manipulate the shape of a figure
	* the blue circle handle is a connection handle. It allows you to create connections between figures.
	* the framed red handles are null handles. They only show the selection status of a figure but don't support any manipulation.
	* the green handles are shown on connections. They enable you to reconnect them with another figure.
	* the yellow handle enables you to change the font size of a text figure or the size of the radius of a rounded rectangle.

---+++ Commands

Commands are invoked from the button bar at the bottom or from the menu bar at the top.

The standard commands that are provided include cut, copy, paste, duplicate, delete, group, ungroup, bring to front, and send to back.


---+++ Attributes

Attributes, such as fill color, text color or arrow tip, can be changed through the attributes menus.

---++ <nop>%TOPIC% Settings

No settings necessary.
