Evidently TDB has existed in the Samba tree for some time but no one
has take the time to package it up and make it a library all its
own. I was looking for something that did what TDB did and Jeremy
Allison pointed me at TDB. 

It worked for me and could see how it was designed to be generally
useful but no one had taken the time to package it up and make it more
widely available. 

I was talking to Andrew Tridgell and offered to package up TDB and
make it more widely available and he jumped at the offer. So here it
is.

So I didn't write it but I am offering it to the world. Use it as you
see fit.
