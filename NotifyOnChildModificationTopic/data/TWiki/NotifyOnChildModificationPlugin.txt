---+ %TOPIC%

This plugin allows some users to be immediately notified by mail each time a child of a given parent topic is modified.

---++ Theory of operation

If this plugin is activated each time a topic =WebTopic= with parent =WebParentTopic= is modified, the web is searched for a topic with name =WebParentTopicNotifyUsers=. If this topic exists an email is sent to each user listed into. The text of the email must be stored in the topic =WebParentTopicNotifyText= or =NotifyText=. If the default email headers do not suits you, it is possible to add the NotifyOnChildModificationForm to your =WebParentTopicNotifyText= or =NotifyText= topic and select other ones.
Note that the new variable =%TOPICPARENT%= can be used in the =.*NotifyText= topics and are replaced with the name of the parent topic (i.e. =WebParentTopic= in the current example).

---++ Example

I used this plugin for a local set of forums implemented using %WIKITOOLNAME%. A forum is build of a main topic which list the entries (child topics of the main topic). The web hosts several forums and I wanted a mean for users to be noticed of entry modifications for a _given_ forum (and not for all forums as do the classical notification of %WIKITOOLNAME%). With the %TOPIC% one can setup a notification system for one forum (of main topic =ForumsMainGeneral=) :
	* First create a topic =ForumsMainGeneralNotifyUsers= with the same syntax as WebNotify topic.
	* Second create a topic with the text of the mail to be sent, in my case I wanted the same notification for all forums so I used the text below in =NotifyText= topic :
<verbatim>
Beloved TWiki user, 

Some modification occured in %TOPICPARENT% forum, the description of this forum is :
%SEARCH{"^%TOPICPARENT%$" scope="topic" regex="on" nosearch="on" nototal="on" noheader="on" format="'$formfield(ForumsFormMainTitle)'"}%

The modified entry title is %SEARCH{"^%TOPIC%$" scope="topic" regex="on" nosearch="on" nototal="on" noheader="on" format="'$formfield(ForumsFormItemTitle)'"}%

Your devoted TWiki system.
</verbatim>
Moreover I wanted to put a custom subject to these emails so I added the form NotifyOnChildModificationForm to the =NotifyText= topic and typed =Something new in forum %TOPICPARENT% != into =NotifyOnChildModificationFormSubject= field.

---++ Thanks

I borrowed most of the perl code from the plain %WIKITOOLNAME% notification system (cgi-bin script =notify=).

---++ Bugs

I'm a C/PHP/Bash programmer not a Perl one, so there is probably a lot of bugs :-) . Ha ! I forgot to tell that I'm not an english speaker so there must be also a lot of errors in my text, please let me know, I will correct them.
