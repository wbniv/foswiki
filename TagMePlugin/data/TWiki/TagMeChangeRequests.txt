%ICON{info}% __Note:__
   * Renaming and deleting of tags is ususally done by users that have received permissions to do this. Permissions are set in [[TagMePlugin#PluginSettings][TagMePlugin's settings]]. 
   * If renaming and deleting of tags is done by someone else than you, use the forms on the [[TagMeRenameTag][Rename]] and [[TagMeDeleteTag][Delete]] pages to automatically add your requests here.
