Fetches a copy of a given file and distribution. 
Saves according to TWiki::Contrib::DistributionContrib::Config;

---++ sub fetchDistributionFile() 

In:
| $file | name of filename, e.g. bin/view |
| $distribution | name of distribution, e.g. TWiki20020201 |
| $localFileSuffix | for the downloaded file, any suffix to be added to the filename |

Out:
| $location | where the local copy of the file has been placed |

NB. the localFileSuffix is a way to allow multiple downloaded files to coexist at the same time.
As the FileFetcher does not provide a way to delete the files (and TWiki does not automatically
refresh its attachment table on the arrival of new attachments), I recommend you use unique names
scarcely. e.g. keep using the same localFileSuffix "1", "2"
