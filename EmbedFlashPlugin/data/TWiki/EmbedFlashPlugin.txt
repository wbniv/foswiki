| =wmode= | Sets the Window Mode property of the Flash movie for transparency, layering, and positioning in the browser. %BR% \
=window= - movie plays in its own rectangular window on a web page. %BR% \
=opaque= - the movie hides everything on the page behind it. %BR% \

| =play= | Specifies whether the movie begins playing immediately on loading in the browser. | ="true"= or ="false"= | ="true"= | 
| =loop= | Specifies whether the movie repeats indefinitely or stops when it reaches the last frame. | ="true"= or ="false"= | ="true"= |

| =swliveconnect= | Specifies whether the browser should start Java when loading the Flash Player for the first time. | ="true"= or ="false"= | =""= |
| =flashvars= | Variables to be passed to the Flash movie. Multiple variables are separated by =&amp;=. | =flashvars="x=50&y=100&url=%<nop>ATTACHURL%/picture.jpg"= | =""= |
