---+!! TWiki Release Tracker Plugin

The TWiki Release Tracker (aka TRT) plugin tells you exactly how your install differs from every production and beta release of TWiki.

---++ Synopsis

This plugin provides an interface to show to what degree a TWiki
installation is different from the distribution from which it was
installed. After installing TWiki, many administrators make minor
modifications to tweak its functionality or to apply patches. While
the some adminstrators keep a patch log, alterations often get
forgotten about. Upgrading poses a problem when adminstrators make
local changes to code because the code changes get lost in the
upgrade.  This in turn can make some users reticent about
upgrading. Furthermore it can be package up and feedback such changes
back to TWiki.org.

This plugin provides a web-based environment to query the differences:
users can walk around the code base, get a per-file fast comparison by
comparing the MD5 index of their installation with that of the
distribution and then examine it in depth by instructing it to produce
diffs. 

The command line environment adds commands that give the user to save
the diffs as a patch file to be used to refit their changes onto a new
release, and that same patch file can be shared with the community to
accelerate TWiki development.

---++ %TOPIC% Overview

---+++ Features and Benefits

	* By generating a content identifier for every file in all TWiki distributions (core beta and release versions, plus all the plugins), the system advises where every file in your install has come from.
	* By providing navigation from installation file content to distribution file content, the system provides the means to generate diffs from your install to a distro. This means that not only can you tell where your version is behind a distribution, but also shows you where you have altered your version. The downloadable diff provides the opportunity to feed back to the TWiki community the change you've made back, meaning for the patch owner less rework the next time TWiki is released and, for the community as a whole, better capture of changes leading to more progress .

---+++ How it works

The TRT centres on the concept of a unique CONTENT identifier - instead of identifying a file *by its filename*, identities are based on *file content*. This means that a file copied to another place has the same unique content identifier. The system used md5 signatures as the identifier.

%TOPIC% is comprised of two parts:
	1 a twiki plugin that provides a web interface to the API of the comparator.
		Unlike previous versions, this one includes in situ building of indexes for the local installation using the web interface.
	1 a command line indexer that builds and saves indexes. This is used to generate the md5 files included in pub/TWiki/TWikiReleaseTrackerPlugin

---++ Plugin Installation and Set up Instructions

	1 Download the ZIP file from the Plugin web (see below).
	1 Unzip Foswiki:Extensions.EditTablePlugin.zip in your twiki installation directory. (This will facilitate sorting the table entries)
	1 This plugin requires Foswiki:Extensions.BuildContrib and Foswiki:Extensions.DistributionContrib to run. If you do not have these two plugins installed, download and install them before proceeding.
	1 Create a md5 index of your local installation by clicking [[%SCRIPTURL%/view%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/TWiki/TRTChangesFromDistribution?mode=indexLocalInstallation][here]]. _(Repeat this step after modifying installation files to create new index.)_
	1 Test if the Plugin is correctly installed:
		* Check the TRTChangesFromDistribution topic and see that the %<nop>DIFFWIKI{}% is expanded into formated report.
	1 For further customization of the default setup, see #Settings below.

---++ Plugin Usage Instructions

---+++ Basic usage
---++++ Web usage
	* The TRT is shipped with data about standard TWiki "Production Releases". By default, the TRTChangesFromDistribution topic automatically generates a report comparing your local installation against the standard TWiki distribution specified by the WIKIVERSION variable. %RED%Note:%ENDCOLOR% If you are running a "Beta Release," you will need to download the "beta.md5" file from Foswiki:Extensions.TWikiReleaseTrackerPluginDev and attach it to your local version of the %TOPIC% topic. 
	* To view the changes for a particular file listed in the report, click on the corresponding link in the "Status" column.
---++++ Command line usage
        * This is strictly experimental - see Foswiki:Extensions.TWikiShellContrib and  Foswiki:Extensions.TWikiReleaseTrackerPluginCommands

---+++ Comparing differences between standard TWiki installations

Even before you have built the index for your own installation, you can use the TRT to determine what changes were made between standard TWiki distributions. For example, click [[%SCRIPTURL%/view%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/TWiki/TRTChangesFromDistribution?from=TWiki19990901&to=TWiki20000501&statusFilter=all][here]] to compare <nop>TWikiRelease01Sep2001 and <nop>TWikiRelease01May2000 production releases. To compare other releases, simply select them from the From and To drop down menus and click the Go button.<!-- N.B. use of TWiki/ not TWiki. because athens did not support its use --> From the drop down menu, you can 

---+++ Advanced usage - Setting custom report parameters

Using the form at the top of TRTChangesFromDistribution, you can override the defaults listed on this page. All parameters specified below can also be overridden on the URL line.

In other words, TRT parameters can be sourced from one of three places:
	1 Defaults listed on the plugin home page
	2 Parameters specified on the %DIFFWIKI{} line
	3 Parameters recognised as a CGI.pm parameter (e.g. on the URL line)

---++++ Parameters to the %DIFFWIKI directive

| *Parameter name* | *Values* | *Default* |
| *Mode = listing* | listing, file | listing |
| fscsFormat | string to show when file is FSCS | &#124; $relativeFile &#124; FSCS &#124; $locations &#124; |
| fscdFormat | string to show when file is FSCD | &#124; $relativeFile &#124; FSCDCALLBACK &#124; FSCDDIST &#124; |
| - | FSCDDIST, FSCDCALLBACK and FDCSDIFF have interesting effects in this setting |
| fdcsFormat | | &#124; $relativeFile &#124; FDCS &#124; $locations &#124; |
| fdcdFormat | | &#124; ($relativeFile name not recognised, and no content match)  &#124; FDCD &#124; &#124; |
| fdcmFormat | | &#124; $relativeFile &#124; FSCM &#124; $locations &#124; |
| headerFormat | | &#124; *File* &#124; *Status* &#124; *Also Occurs In* &#124; |
| from | TWiki distribution name (e.g. TWiki20011201), or the string 'localInstallation' | localInstallation |
| to | (see "from") | , - this says match against all distributions |
| indexTopic | topic containing the md5 files | defaults to the plugin page |
| debug | on, off, 2 | off |
| statusFilter | "FSCS,FSCD,FSCM,FDCS,FDCD,all" (Filename Same/Different, Content Same/Matches (other dist)/Different) | FDCD,FSCS,FDCM |
| *Mode = file* |  ||
| file | filename to compare | - |
| *Mode = dumpIndex* | Shows indexes loaded | - |
| *Mode = indexLocalDistribution* | Regenerates the localInstallation.md5 file, use after modifying files | |

---++++ Limitations
| *Issue* | *Future Plan* | *Impact* |
| To compare specific file changes (FSCD = File Same, Content Different), you need to have pre-downloaded all of the releases. | My plan is to have the plugin pull them down as needed, but I need a web address for a specific twiki version / file; currently this is not available (partly due to the switch to subversion) | High - file mode not yet functional |
| The MD5 for specific releases (i.e. releases.md5) needs pregenerating. | Release the code (actually a merge for the TWiki:Codev.SharedCode) when I have cleaned it up | Low - releases are not very often |
| If you want an unspecified destination (to) or source (from) distro you must set the param to "," | check for undef, not "" | Medium - ugly non-obvious workaround available |
| The results are not sorted | sort them | Low - workaround available: Use table sort function |
| The underlying data structures could do with some optimisation | Review | Low - Page load is slow in some cases |

---++ Default Plugin Settings
One line description, is shown in the TextFormattingRules topic: 
		* Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Plugin telling you how similar your install is to past releases of TWiki 

See the Parameters section for descriptions of the rest of these:
		* Set STATUSFILTER = FSCD,FDCS,FDCM
		* Set FROM = localInstallation
		* Set TO = ,
		* Set FSCDFORMAT = | $relativeFile | FSCDCALLBACK (show diffs) | FSCDDIST |
      
---++ Future plans
	* Make the TRT detect inconsistent indexes and offer to regenerate the localInstallation md5 file if necessary
	* Make test suite Foswiki:Extensions.BuildContrib <nop>TestRunner compatible
	* Make use of Foswiki:Extensions.AttrsContrib
	* Investigate why the -w flag to diff is necessary
	* md5 files will be pulled from a server rather than distributed
