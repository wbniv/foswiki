---+!! CliRunnerContrib Contrib Package

%X% The previous discussion has been moved to CliRunnerContribDev.

This is a Contrib targeted at TWiki developers.  It allows to run
independent TWiki scripts from your TWiki code (mostly unit tests).

%X%%X% This Contrib requires the yet-to-be released TWiki version 4.1!

Note that the detailed documentation has been generated automatically
by the TWiki:Plugins.BuildContrib, and would need care to be
comprehensible.  For use cases and examples, see the test cases file
provided with this contrib, which are not in the distribution, but
available from SVN.

---++ Summary of Contents

This contrib describes a =$runner= object which allows to run TWiki
scripts from your TWiki code in an independent process.  The object
methods allow to change the options, configuration, and module
environment for the single request performed by the independent
process.  All other simultaneous TWiki operations remain unaffected.

---++ Use Cases

The most important use cases for this contrib are "special" unit
tests - tests which can neither be performed with TWiki's usual test
case mechanisms, nor with LWP or browser tests:

   1 Test cases where you want to change the set of available CPAN
     modules:  This can't be done from conventional test cases because
     they all "see" the same Perl libraries, and once a module has
     been compiled it can't be removed.  And it can't be done with
     browser tests because the browser has no access to your
     libraries.  You _could_, of course, rename your CPAN library
     temporarily, but this may affect other users, or other services
     on the same computer.
   1 Test cases where you need to run all checks and capture the
     complete output.  Such tests could be done by capturing the
     output of e.g. =do view;= - but this would splatter the
     namespaces and global variables of the testing environment.
     That property is interesting for =mod_perl= like tests, but
     not for "usual" CGI simulation where every request runs in its
     own process.

---++ Settings

Settings are stored as preferences variables. To reference a setting write ==%<nop>&lt;plugin&gt;_&lt;setting&gt;%==, e.g. ==%<nop>CLIRUNNERCONTRIB_STUB%==

   * One line description:
      * Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Run independent TWiki scripts from your TWiki code (mostly unit tests)

   * Name of the perl package
      * Set STUB = %$STUB%

---++ Installation Instructions
	* Download the ZIP file from the Plugin web (see below)
	* Unzip ==%TOPIC%.zip== in your twiki installation directory. Content:
	| *File:* | *Description:* |
%$MANIFEST%
	* Run ==%TOPIC%_installer.pl== to automatically check and install other modules that this module depends on. You can also do this step manually. Dependencies:
	%$DEPENDENCIES%

   * Test if the installation was successful:
      * Run =WebTestCasesAutoTests.pm= in the =test/unit= directory.
        If the installation was successful, you see a couple of tests.
        The tests may not succeed, but this is another matter....
