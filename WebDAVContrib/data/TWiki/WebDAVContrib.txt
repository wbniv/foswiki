%TOC%

!WebDAV support for !NextWiki (and TWiki).

!WebDAV stands for "Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning". It is a set of extensions to the HTTP protocol which allows users to collaboratively edit and manage files on remote web servers. 

This contrib contains a !WebDAV implementation for Apache 2 =mod_perl=,
and an interface module that allows it to be used with FilesysVirtualContrib,
thereby giving access to the NextWiki datastore via the WebDAV protocol.
Integration with <nop>Web<nop>DAV means that users can edit topics and
attachments using an appropriate <nop>Web<nop>DAV enabled client program,
such as Microsoft&trade; Word&trade; or KWrite.

Users can drag and drop attachments into the topic, and they will
automatically be versioned and added to the topic attachment table. Topics
can be created in webs by dragging and dropping =.txt= files into the
directory representing the web.

!NextWiki permissions are honoured throughout.

This module is a complete ground-up rewrite of the !WebDAVPlugin.
