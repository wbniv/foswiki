%TOC%

This module provides an implementation =Filesys::Virtual= implementation layered over a NextWiki store. See CPAN:Filesys::Virtual for more information.

Obviously a full filesystem is a lot more generic than a NextWiki store, so there needs to be some mapping between what is in the store and the filesystem, and some constraints on what can and can't be done with the filesystem.

The store is mapped as follows:
   * Webs are directories
   * Topics are seen as plain files that have a .txt extension, e.g. =MyTopic.txt=
   * Attachments are stored in a =Topic_files/= directory, e.g. =MyTopic_files/=

Wiki access controls are respected at all levels in the store. Note:
   1 You cannot create subdirectories in =_files= directories

The module currently uses =TWiki::Func= methods with the absolute minimum of unavoidable kick-down to the file system when the APIs just don't provide the required information. At the moment it uses standard access control checking methods, but the plan is to add a permissions cache. For this reason it is a plugin so it can if necessary implement handlers that watch for topic saves.
