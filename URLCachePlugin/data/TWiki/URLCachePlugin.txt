---+Caches URLs referenced in the text.

This is a plugin which will download a web page that is referenced in a topic and change the link to point to the cached page. The cached pages will have a date showing when it was cached, and a link to the original page. 

There are two ways of caching a page, either as a new topic, or as a separate data file (similar to attachments). See below under *Syntax Rules* for more information on how to define what type of caching is done. In either case clicking the link will open the page in the current browser window.

*Please note that web pages are only cached the first time the are found, the link is then changed so it will not be re-cached.* 

---++ Syntax Rules

Any string that begins with *http* or *https* and is at the beginning of a line or has a space before it will be cached. The URL is assumed to be everything from the beginning of the http(s) until a space or end of line is encountered. If you have a URL that includes a space you should replace the space with the code *%20*.These pages will be downloaded with any style sheets and/or images as well, i.e. it attempts to make a exact copy of the original page.

If you add a + (plus sign) in front it will cache it as a new topic. The topic will use the URL minus the http:// prefix as the name. In this case the page will only be stored as plain text, with some very basic formatting attempted.

The difference between caching as a standalone page or as a topic is that topics can be searched through the normal TWiki search engine.

To avoid having URLs cached you have three options:
	* For single URLs just make sure it does not have spaces around it, you may use normal brackets: (http://mylink.com) or a TWiki formatting code such as underscores for italic.
	* For an entire page put the following code anywhere in the page: *&lt;!--NOCACHE--&gt;* this is in fact a hidden HTML comment and will not show up in the page itself.
	* For an entire web (for instance the main TWiki web which has lots of pointers to live support information) add them to the _IGNORE_ setting below. By default the TWiki web is there already.

---++ Plugin Settings

Plugin settings are stored as preferences variables. To reference
a plugin setting write ==%<nop>&lt;plugin&gt;_&lt;setting&gt;%==, i.e. ==%<nop>URLCACHEPLUGIN_SHORTDESCRIPTION%==

	* One line description, is shown in the %TWIKIWEB%.TextFormattingRules topic:
		* Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = This plugin copies a referenced webpage to the TWiki server to avoid broken links

	* Stop these webs from being cached, list them as a comma separate list here
		* Set IGNORE = %TWIKIWEB%
		
	* Debug plugin: (See output in =data/debug.txt=)
		* Set DEBUG = 0

---++ Plugin Installation Instructions
__Note:__ These instructions are for the TWiki maintainer. No changes to your browser are required. *This plugin uses several additional CPAN Perl modules (listed below), make sure they are all installed and working.*
