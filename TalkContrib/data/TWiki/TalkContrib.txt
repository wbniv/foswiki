---++ Usage
<nop> TalkContrib adds a wikipedia like _Discuss_ Button to the PatternSkin edit&attach buttons, and to the topic action bar of the Classic, default and Foswiki:Extensions.MoveveableTypeSkin. 

When the user initially clicks on the 'Discuss topic' button, it will create a new topic by appending =Talk= to the original topic. 
From then on, you can switch between the topic and its Discussion topic using that button.

---++ Installation and Configuration Instructions
---+++ 'Talk' topics in created in the same web as the topic, with 'Talk' Suffix
<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/TalkSuffix.jpg" alt="TalkSuffix.jpg" width='320' height='200' style="float:right;margin:10px;border:1px solid black;"/>

To enable Talk Topics, add the =talk= skin to the SKIN path in %USERSWEB%.SitePreferences or the <nop>WebPreferences topic of whatever web you want to enable Talk topics in (eg, if you're using PatternSkin):
<verbatim>
      * Set <nop>SKIN = talk,pattern
</verbatim>
_OR_ by setting the COVER setting to =talk= _OR_ by putting the contents of =templates/view.talk.tmpl= into a topic, and setting VIEW_TEMPLATE to reference that topic (ok, rather advanced usage)


You can over-ride the suffix (defaults to =Talk=) that is appended to a topic to create its Talk topic by setting =TALKSUFFIX= in %USERSWEB%.SitePreferences
<verbatim>
      * Set <nop>TALKSUFFIX = Talk
</verbatim>

You can over-ride the Topic template that is used when creating a new Talk topic by setting =TALKTOPICTEMPLATE= in %USERSWEB%.SitePreferences
<verbatim>
      * Set <nop>TALKTOPICTEMPLATE = %SYSTEMWEB%.MyTalkTemplate
</verbatim>
You can over-ride the Topic formtemplate that is used when creating a new Talk topic by setting =TALKTOPICFORMTEMPLATE= in %USERSWEB%.SitePreferences
<verbatim>
      * Set <nop>TALKTOPICFORMTEMPLATE = %SYSTEMWEB%.MyTalkFormTemplate
</verbatim>



I have tested TalkContrib using TWiki 4.2.0 with the default skin (used as a building block for other skins), ClassicSkin, PatternSkin and Foswiki:Extensions.MoveveableTypeSkin.

---++ Limitations
There are 2 known limitations at this time
   1 any topic containing the TALKSUFFIX will be considered a Talk topic - this is due to a bug in %SYSTEMWEB%.VarIF string matching
   2 you cannot create Talk topics for topics in webs you do not have change permission. This will not be solved in the Talk Suffix mode.

---++ Discussion and future ideas

There are many approaches to storing Talk discussions:
   1 append a 'Talk' suffix to the name of the topic, and link to that
      * Talk topics are normal topics that conform to a naming scheme, thus are listed in WebChanges seperatly from their parent topics
   2 convert the web and topic name to some reversible but otherwise unlikely combination, and store in a seperate Talk web
   3 use Subwebs with common topic names
   4 use a formfield in the topic to store the Talk
   5 use a META:PREF in the topic to store the Talk
   
This Foswiki Application implements the first using either a SKIN or COVER setting or using VIEW_TEMPLATE. The other modes will be examined over time.
