%RED% This is an alpha version and is still under development. See ConditionalPluginDev for discussion. %ENDCOLOR% 

This plugin adds the ability to do simple, not nested, conditional rendering in topics. 

It attempts to do this in a relatively secure manner by applying the following security measures:
	* restrictive filter for the expression of 'scalar operator scalar' 
		* where 'operator' must be one of ==,>,<,<=,>=,!=,eq,ne,gt,lt,le,ge,<=>,cmp,=~,!~
		* the list of valid operators is hardcoded and cannot be changed by users
		* and 'scalar' is a string consisting of alphanumeric characters + underscore with no whitespace (\w)
	* evaluation of the expression in a sandbox, created with the [[http://search.cpan.org/author/JHI/perl-5.8.0/ext/Opcode/Safe.pm Safe ]] module. 
		* only the opcodes in the :base_core set are allowed (see [[http://search.cpan.org/author/JHI/perl-5.8.0/ext/Opcode/Opcode.pm Opcode]])

More sophisticated constructs (like support for range-conditions or nested constructs) may appear in future revisions, if and when the need for them
arises.

---++ Syntax Rules

	* <nop>%IF{ scalar operator scalar }% text %ELSE% text %ENDIF%
	* the '<nop>%ELSE% text' clause is optional

	* __Note__: at the moment nested if-else-endif constructs are not supported.

---++ Examples

The following example prints something dependent on the topicname (can be usefull in templates)

	* <nop>%IF{ %<nop>TOPIC% eq WebHome }% This is the WebHome topic %ELSE% This is NOT the WebHome topic %ENDIF%

Result

	 * %IF{ %TOPIC% eq WebHome }% This is the WebHome topic %ELSE% This is NOT the WebHome topic %ENDIF%

A different approach, without the 'else' clause:

	 * This is <nop>%IF{ %<nop>TOPIC% ne WebHome }% NOT %ENDIF% the WebHome topic

Which of course als results in:

	* This is %IF{ %TOPIC% ne WebHome }% NOT %ENDIF% the WebHome topic

Or:
	* <nop>%IF{ %<nop>GMTIME{"$hour"}% > 18 }% __Good evening folks!!__  %ELSE% __Good day folks!!__ %ENDIF%

Which results in:
	* %IF{ %GMTIME{"$hour"}% > 18 }% __Good evening folks!!__  %ELSE% __Good day folks!!__ %ENDIF%

---++ <nop>%TOPIC% Global Settings

Plugin settings are stored as preferences variables. To reference a plugin setting write ==%<nop>&lt;plugin&gt;_&lt;setting&gt;%==, i.e. ==%<nop>INTERWIKIPLUGIN_SHORTDESCRIPTION%==

	* One line description, is shown in the %SYSTEMWEB%.TextFormattingRules topic:
		* Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Adds conditional rendering (if/then/else)

	* Debug plugin: (See output in =data/debug.txt=)
		* Set DEBUG = 0
