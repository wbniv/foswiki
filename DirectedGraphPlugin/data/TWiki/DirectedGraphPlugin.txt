---++ Introduction

Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks. Automatic graph drawing has many important applications in software engineering, database and web design, networking, and in visual interfaces for many other domains.

This plugin uses [[http://www.graphviz.org/][Graphviz's]] applications to create an image of a directed graph. The directed graph is described using a simple text markup called "The DOT Language".  This markup is written between <verbatim><dot> ... </dot></verbatim> tags.   By default, a png image attachment is created and displayed inline, replacing the <verbatim><dot></verbatim> markup.  Any other requested formats are saved as attachments.  

| %X% By default, this version of the plugin uses the TWik API to manipulate the attached graphs.  The first user to view a topic containing a directed graph will be denied access if they do not have update permission.  If defaults or DOT parameters have changed, viewing the topic may modify attachments, which will require update permission. |

| %X% *Caution* The plugin will also update attached files during __Preview__.  if the edit is subsequently canceled, the attachments will be regenerated again. |

A MD5 hash is calculated for each dot command input and the results saved in the TWiki work_area directory. The hash file is named with the Web name, the Topic name, and the string ==-filehash==  The location of the workarea has changed in recent TWiki releases.  If the calculated hash matches on subsequent page visits, the attached graphics files are used without rerunning Graphviz. If the hash doesn't match, the attachments are regenerated.  

Default behavior is to leave any previously generated attachments even if the =&lt;dot&gt;= tags are removed from the file.  If the configuration setting DELETEATTACHMENTS is enabled, then the plugin will remove any old attachments that are not needed.  However if the final =&lt;dot&gt;= tag is removed, the plugin is not invoked, and the attachments will not be deleted. 

<blockquote>
| %X% *Caution!* If a topic has not previously been processed by this version of the plugin, attachments named using the original "Graph[32 character hex checksum].jpg will *all* be deleted from the topic when this parameter is enabled! Once the new ==-filehash== file has been created, old style attachments will not be deleted.  If you want to go back and clean up the old atachment filenames, you can remove the =Web_Topic-filehash= file from the workare directory. |
</blockquote>

In TWiki 4.2.0 and later, if a topic is renamed, the ==-filehash== file in the TWiki workarea directory will be renamed as well and regeneration of attachment files will be avoided.  In previous versions, there is no afterRenameHandler.  The hash file will be orphaned, and the graphics attachments will be regenerated when the page is displayed.


| %X% *Caution* =&lt;dot&gt;= syntax is not currently compatible with the WYSIWYG editor.  Raw editing is recommended, or use &lt;sticky&gt; tags to protect the dot tags. |

Also note that after changes that modify the order of generated image names, it may be necessary to refresh the browser cache with shift-reload.

Visit the [[http://www.graphviz.org/Gallery.php][Graphviz gallery]] to see some examples on what can be achieved with this plugin and Graphviz. Full documentation is available at http://graphviz.org/Documentation.php.

<nop>DirectedGraphPlugin supports the following engines:

   * =dot= - makes "hierarchical" or layered drawings of directed graphs. The layout algorithm aims edges in the same direction (top to bottom, or left to right) and then attempts to avoid edge crossings and reduce edge length.  This is the default engine.
   * =neato= and =fdp= - make "spring model" layouts. neato uses the Kamada-Kawai algorithm, which is equivalent to statistical multi-dimensional scaling. fdp implements the Fruchterman-Reingold heuristic including a multigrid solver that handles larger graphs and clustered undirected graphs.
   * =twopi= - radial layout, after Graham Wills 97.
   * =circo= - circular layout, after Six and Tollis 99, Kauffman and Wiese 02. Suitable for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.

---++ Syntax Rules

Enclose the description for your directed graph within =&lt;dot&gt; ... &lt;/dot&gt;= tags.

You can use the following parameters in the =dot= tag to control the rendering of your graph (All parameters are optional):

| *Parameter:* | *Description:* | *Default:* |
| =map="on"= | Create a client side map for the generated image. This will turn any =[URL="..."];= attribute in the graph description into a clickable area (see demonstration below). | =off= |
| =vectorformats="ps svg"= | The PNG file created from the graph per default is a bitmap file. If you need a vector based file rendering or other bitmap types as well, you can specify =ps=, =svg= and =jpg= formats (will be attached to topic, visible under attachments view). Any format supported by !GraphViz is supported by this plugin. It is mapped to the =-T= parameter. | none |
| =engine="neato"= | Which layout engine to use for the graph: One of =dot=, =neato=, =twopi=, =circo= or =fdp=. | =dot= |
| =library="Main.GroupIcons"= | Which icon library topic to use for custom shapes ([shapefile] parameter). Needs to be explicitly set, also if icons are attached locally to the current graph topic. See demo below. | =TWiki.DirectedGraphPlugin= |
| =file="file_prefix"= | Overrides the dynamically generated filenames. If specified, must be unique for each graph within a single topic! Suffix is still generated automatically based upon file type.  | =graph_nn= nn increments per graph |
| =hideattachments="on"= | Set whether or not attachments should be hidden from the attachment table | =on= |
| =inlineattachment="png"= | Specifies the type of file to be attached inline to the page.  Must be png or jpg. | =png= |
| =linkattachments="off"= | Add links for file types other than the inline type if present | =off= |
| =dothash="on"= | Controls the hash calculation against the dot command input. If the dot hash is disabled, a previously created .png file will not be recreated unless the attachment is deleted, or the =dothash= parameter is enabled or removed. This can be used to create a portable topic and attachments that can be moved without regenerating all of the graphs. Used in the HowtoDirectedGraphs topic. | =on= |
| =forceattachapi="off"= | Force standard TWiki attachment API processing.  Ignores setting of configure attachPath and attachUrlPath parameters.  Used to create portable topic across TWiki installations. | =off= |
| *Postscript based Antialiasing (optional)* |||
| =antialias="on"= | Enable antialiasing of current graph by setting this to =on=. Note that if Graphviz is installed with the cairo rendering engine, this option should not be needed. When enabled, a postscript image is created, and post-processed with the ImageMagick "convert" utility. | =off= |
| =density="300"= | Passed to the imagemagick =convert= utility. Specifies the dots per inch used for image generation.  | =300= |
| =size="2000x1600"= | Passed to the imagemagick =convert= as the ="-geometry"= parameter and controls size of rendered image (use =size= parameter in graph description for controlling the size of the image with antialiasing =off=). | =800x600= |

Sitewide default settings are set in this topic and can be overwritten for each graph. When you change a setting the graph will be re-generated unless the =dothash= option is set to =off=.

---++ <nop>%TOPIC% Global Settings

Changes to the settings marked %X% will cause changes to the file hash.  This will result in the attached graphcs being regenerated on the next view.

   * One line description, shown in the %TWIKIWEB%.TextFormattingRules topic: 
      * Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Embed directed graphs in TWiki topics (using the Graphviz package)

   * %X% Layout engine to use per default. Can be one of =dot=, =neato=, =twopi=, =circo=, =fdp= 
      * Set ENGINE = dot

   * %X% Antialias option. If set to =on= the plugin will use the =convert= binary from the imagemagick package to pretty print graphs. This option should not be used with clientside maps as pixel dimensions are usually altered in this process and therefore the "hot spot" locations will not match the generated image. With antialiasing off, rendering size is controlled by =dot= (can be effected by an eventual size parameter in the digraph description), with antialiasing on you set the final image size in pixels explicitly with the size parameter. (If you must use an image map with this option, take care manually that the two generated pixel sizes match). 
      * Set ANTIALIAS = off

   * %X% Default density (dpi) for antialias option. 300 dpi should be sufficient for most purposes (if your graphs look blurred at large image sizes try using a higher value). 
      * Set DENSITY = 300

   * %X% Set whether or not attached files should be automatically hidden in the attachments table. 
      * Set HIDEATTACHMENTS = on

   * %X% Set the format for inline attachment files. 
      * Set INLINEATTACHMENT = png

   * Include links for other attachment types if specified. 
      * Set LINKATTACHMENTS = on

   * If enabled, the plugin will delete any remaining attachments when  a =&lt;dot&gt;= is removed or modified.
      * Set DELETEATTACHMENTS = off

   * If enabled, the plugin will ignore the "configure" settings of =attachPath= and =attachUrlPath=.  Forcing use of the attachment API can be used to create topics that are portable across TWiki installations.  (for example, the HowtoDirectedGraphs topic)  It can be also used to get standard attachment revision history handling on the generated attachments. [This parameter is ignored and the TWiki attachment API always used if the configure settings =attachPath= and =attachUrlPath= are not supplied.
      * Set FORCEATTACHAPI = off

   * %X% Default image size (pixels, =widthxheight=) for antialias option (keeps aspect ratio; enlarges until max of one of the dimensions is reached). 
      * Set SIZE = 800x600

   * %X% Additional vector formats to create per default. Displayed version defaults to PNG, others are attached. Options are =ps= and =svg= (space separated). Any output format supported by !GraphViz can be specified. The =ps= format is useful to have handy if you are later converting your document to <nop>LaTeX or other typesetting / publication utility. The =svg= format has inline clickable map if used. 
      * Set VECTORFORMATS = none

   * %X% Default topic to read library icons (shapefiles) from 
      * Set LIBRARY = TWiki.DirectedGraphPlugin

   * Debug plugin: (See output in =data/debug.txt=) 
      * Set DEBUG = 0

---++ Plugin Installation Instructions

__Note:__ The following instructions are for the administrator who installs the plugin on the server where TWiki is running.
   * Install the Graphviz package
   * On Linux install cairo and the graphviz-cairo plugin if desired
   * Install required web fonts
   * Install the <nop>ImageMagick package
   * Install the Perl module Digest::MD5
   * Download the ZIP file from the Plugin web (see below)
   * Unzip ==%TOPIC%.zip== in your twiki installation directory.
   * Using the TWiki =configure= interface, set the paths to the graphviz =dot= and <nop>ImageMagick =convert= commands, along with perl, and the TWiki tools directory.
   * [Optional] Set the attachPath and attachUrlPath.  These can be set to match the TWiki pubUrlPath and pubDir settings, or set to a web-readable directory outside of TWiki.  
      * If not set, the standard TWiki "attach" API will be used by the plugin. View users will require "update" permission if the plugin needs to regenerate the attached files.
      * If the attachPath is set, standard TWiki attachment handling will be bypassed and files will be written directly to this path.  Attachments will not be subject to revision controls.
      * If the attachPath is _not_ the TWiki pub directory, then the attachUrlPath must be configured for the plugin to generate correct URLs.
      * %X% The plugin does not attempt to manage attachments across changes between direct file I/O and the TWiki API.  Attachments can be orphaned when these parameters are changed.

   * %X% For TWiki 4.0.1, the =configure= interface does not set plugin variables.  Manually insert the following lines into the lib/TWiki.cfg file 
      * =$TWiki::cfg{DirectedGraphPlugin}{enginePath} = '/usr/bin/';=
      * =$TWiki::cfg{DirectedGraphPlugin}{magickPath} = '/usr/bin/';=
      * =$TWiki::cfg{DirectedGraphPlugin}{toolsPath} = '[complete path of twiki/tools/ directory]';=
      * =$TWiki::cfg{DirectedGraphPlugin}{perlCmd} = '/usr/bin/perl';=
      * =$TWiki::cfg{DirectedGraphPlugin}{attachPath} = '';=   [optional]
      * =$TWiki::cfg{DirectedGraphPlugin}{attachUrlPath} = '';= [optional]

   * Verify your installation
      * Ensure that the =dot= command can manually generate a png file.  
      * If using the antialias option, ensure that ImageMagic =convert= command can convert from a .ps to .png format.

   * Errors returned by the plugin:
| *Error* | *Description* |
| ==DirectedGraph Error (1):== on all examples. | Verify the value of =perlCmd= in lib/LocalSite.cfg |
| ==DirectedGraph Error (2):== on all examples | Verify the value of =toolsPath= in lib/LocalSite.cfg |
| ==DirectedGraph Error (9): <br /> The system cannot find the path specified.== on all examples | Verify the value of =enginePath= in lib/LocalSite.cfg | 
| ==DirectedGraph Error (9): <br /> !DirectedGraphPlugin error:Format: "png" not recognized.==  Format might be any of =png=, =ps=, or =cmapx= | !GraphViz was not configured or built correctly.  Try running ==dot -c -vV== to reconfigure and show the file formats supported by the installation |
| ==DirectedGraph Error (1):==  on the antialias examples | Verify the =magickPath= in lib/LocalSite.cfg |
| ==DirectedGraph Error (1):==  on the antialias examples | Verify that !GhostScript is installed correctly.  From a command prompt attempt to convert a .ps file to .gif format.   If !ImageMagick reports =="Postscript delegate failed:"== error, then the problem is probably with !GhostScript |

---+++ Notes on antialiasing

There are two ways to accomplish antialiased output. The older method, enabled by the ==antialias="on"== parameter::
   * generate the graph output in postscript format (.ps)
   * convert to png format using <nop>ImageMagick (convert) command
   * <nop>ImageMagick uses <nop>GhostScript internally to from postscript.

This method is not compatible with client side image maps unless the imagesize rendered by graphviz is the same as the final output from ImageMagick. For example, the following parameters will result in compatible maps.

   $ dot parameters passed to =convert=: antialias="1" size="300x300" density="100" library="TWiki.DirectedGraphPlugin" 
      * Size the image size in dots, density is dots per inch.
   $ graph parameters used by =dot=: digraph G { size="2,3!"; dpi="100"; 
      * Size is the image size in inches, ! = scale to fill one dimension.

The other method is to directly render the graph with graphviz using the cairo backend, "which has antialiased, path-based graphics".

As documented on the [[http://www.graphviz.org/doc/FAQ.html#Q8][graphviz FAQ]] on the "Linux bleeding edge", install the cairo graphics backend library, along with the graphviz-cairo plugin. (It appears that the current graphviz includes cairo support without the plugin.)

You can determine what rendering engine is used for any specified file type by running the =dot= command from the command shell. *If the rendering is done with cairo, you already have antialiased output and should not need to use the =antialias="on"= parameter.*
