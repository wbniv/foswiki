<h3>Setting up tracking for an XP project</h3>

<em>See TrackingIntro for nomenclature</em>

 Creation of pages is recursive, each page has an html form to create child pages:

	* <b>Projects/Teams</b>. You can create a new project page using the html form on the home page for the tracking web. You can create a new team page using the form on the project page. You can add additional content to these pages if desired, but do not delete the existing content. This is used to provide high level overviews of schedule progress.

	* <b>Iterations</b> Create new iterations from the team pages. The iteration name can be anything as long as it does not clash with any of the existing names.

	* <b>Stories</b> Create new stories from the iteration page. The story name can be any unique name, <b>as long as it ends with the string "Story"</b>. Fill in the two tables for the story summary and task list respectively. Note - if you have the EditTablePlugin installed do not press "Edit Page" to change the story tables, click "Edit table" and enter data directly into tables. Add details on tasks in the section below the tasks table.
