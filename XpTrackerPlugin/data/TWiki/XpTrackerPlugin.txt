---+ XP Tracker Plugin

<b>Version 3.2.2 - Jan 27 2005</b>

This is a plugin for tracking [[http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremeProgramming][eXtreme Programming]] projects. The original code was
written by TWiki:Main.RichardBennett, It was converted into this plugin by
TWiki:Main.MartinWatt and enhanced by TWiki:Main.AndreaBacchetta, TWiki:Main.AnthonPang, TWiki:Main.AndreaSterbini, TWiki:Main.ThomasEschner, and TWiki:Main.RafaelAlvarez

See Foswiki:Extensions/XpTrackerPluginHistory for a description of changes in this new version.

---++Documentation
The documentation is hosted in the Twiki.org site, and is not being distributed with the plugin as it's an ongoing effort.

---++ Description

---+++Layout

There is a hierarchy of information here:

	* *Web* - the TWiki web for XP tracking. One web can be used to track multiple products.
	* *Project* - the project being worked on for a Product. Usually this will be the next major release. Each project has a page, which contains an auto-generated summary of the project progress.
	* *Team* - Each project has one or more teams, groups of developers that work on one aspect of the project. Each team has a page which contains an auto-generated summary of the team's progress.
	* *Iteration* - a project is divided into a series of short iterations. Each iteration has a page, the contents of which are also auto-generated.
	* *Story* - An iteration comprises a number of stories. Stories are pieces of related functionality that are owned by a lead developer but can be worked on by more than one developer. The story page contains information on the acceptance criteria, and also a list of tasks.
	* *Tasks* - these are the atomic units of work. A story is usually broken up into a number of tasks. Tasks may be shared among more than one developer. Tasks details are entered on the story page.

__Information is entered for Stories and their associated tasks, and for iteration dates. Information for all other levels in the hierarchy is automatically generated.__

---+++Usage

 Creation of pages is recursive, each page has an html form that uses a template to create child pages:

	* <b>Projects/Teams</b>. You can create a new project page using the html form on the home page for the tracking web. You can create a new team page using the form on the project page. You can add additional content to these pages if desired, but do not delete the existing content. This is used to provide high level overviews of schedule progress. Projects and Teams will not be shown in the pages if they don't have any iteration.

	* <b>Iterations</b> Create new iterations from the team pages.

	* <b>Stories</b> Create new stories from the iteration page. The story name can be any unique name, <b>as long as it ends with the string "Story"</b>. Fill in the two tables for the story summary and task list respectively.

---++ Limitations
	* This version has not been checked against data from V2.0. 

---++ Additional TWiki plugins/changes needed to get this plugin to work at its best

	* The plugin should work in a standard 01Dec2001, 01Feb2003 and TWiki20040119beta TWiki install, but it is easier to use with these additional plugins:
		* Foswiki:Extensions.TablePlugin is optional but useful as it allows you to sort tabulated information by column
		* Foswiki:Extensions.EditTablePlugin is used to simplify entering of stories and tasks. The latest version (with support for the %<nop>EDITCELL% variable) is required.
	* If not using the latest TWiki version, you need to apply the patch in TWiki:Codev.AfterSavePluginHandler
