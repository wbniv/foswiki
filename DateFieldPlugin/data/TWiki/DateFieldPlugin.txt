Provides support for a new type, =date=, in form fields. When a form field is set to this type it will no longer be editable by normal means, but only through a date selection popup.

*WARNING: TWiki-4 only. If you want to use this plugin with an earlier version of TWiki, please see [[http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Plugins/%TOPIC%?rev=1.5][here]]*

---+ Usage

In a form definition, enter =date= where you would normally put =text= . For example:
<verbatim>
| Birthday | date | 0 | 1 April 2004 | A date |
</verbatim>
This will display an *uneditable* text field and a date selection icon that can be clicked to use the Mishoo Javascript calendar widget to insert a date. The =size= field is ignored.

If you want to use Javascript to create other data types in form fields, you can use this plugin as a model of how to do it.

---+ Settings
<!--
Required for old TWiki versions
	* Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Adds a =date= type to forms
-->
The default date format is taken from the JSCalendarContrib settings. You can change the date format by setting the TWiki variable 'DATEFORMAT' in your !TWikiPreferences, your !WebPreferences or in a topic. For example:
   * Set <nop>DATEFORMAT = %c
Look up =strftime= in Google for a full list of the format options.

The plugin can default to todays date by setting the TWiki variable 'DATEFIELDPLUGIN_DEFAULTTOTODAY' in your !TWikiPreferences, your !WebPreferences or in a topic.  For example:
   * Set <nop>DATEFIELDPLUGIN_DEFAULTTOTODAY = 1

See JSCalendarContrib for additional settings.
