A plugin for use in navigating arbitrary collections of slides

%TOC%

------

Although TWiki is good at presenting hierarchical information I needed a way to store a collection of slides, used in internal training, and to navigate those slides in arbitrary ways.  I didn't want to have to mark each slide, as has been done before, and I wanted slides to be able to be used in more than one presentation.  The <nop>SlideNav plugin aims to help with this.

To use this plugin you should also be using the <nop>SlidePlugin which is stored and documented seperately.

Once you have installed the plugin you create an index topic which contains a bulleted set of other topics which are the slides.  Which presentation a user is reading at any time is controlled through a CGI Query variable, named =presentation=.  For example, if I were to be reading a presentation named __codespelunking__ that would looke like:
<verbatim>
...wiki/bin/view/Sandbox/CodeSpelunking?presentation=CodeSpelunking
</verbatim>

In order to make starting a presentation easier a link with a similar target should be placed into the index topic.

---++ Syntax Rules

   * Each slide topic must be places in its own bullet:

<nop>* <nop>SlideTopicOne

<nop>* <nop>SlideTopicTwo

---++ Examples

   *

---++ Plugin Settings

Plugin settings are stored as preferences variables. To reference a plugin setting write ==%<nop>&lt;plugin&gt;_&lt;setting&gt;%==, i.e. ==%<nop>INTERWIKIPLUGIN_SHORTDESCRIPTION%==

   * One line description, is shown in the %TWIKIWEB%.TextFormattingRules topic:
      * Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = A slide navigator

   * Debug plugin: (See output in =data/debug.txt=)
      * Set DEBUG = 0
