This is a Tracking System implemented using %SYSTEMWEB%.DataForms. It has been implemented to be used in a web on its own, but could be intermingled with a discussion style !TWikiWeb.

A customised version of it has been in use as TWiki's bug tracking and shakeout system since 2005 - See http://develop.twiki.org/~twiki4/cgi-bin/view/Bugs.

The BugsContrib is a _TWikiApplication_ (an application that is implemented entirely in TWiki topics). It is designed to use the left bars supported by %SYSTEMWEB%.PatternSkin and the TWiki:Plugins.MoveableTypeSkin, though could easily be converted to another skin. It's ideal for a small bug database (we have used it with over 4000 items with no problems) for a disciplined team.

---+++ Installation Instructions

	* First, check that you do no have an existing web called "Bugs". if you do, move it out of the way.
	* Download the archive from the Plugins web (see below)
	* Unpack it in your twiki installation directory. Content:
     | *File:* | *Description:* |
%$MANIFEST%
	* Make sure that all files are readable by the web server user
	* Run =perl= ==%TOPIC%_installer.pl== =install= to automatically check and install other TWiki modules that this module depends on, that you may not have installed. This script also includes an =uninstall= option should you ever wish to remove the plugin from your installation, and an =upgrade= option that will automatically download and install the latest version.

See the Bugs.WebHome topic in the new web for help in configuring the application to your needs.
