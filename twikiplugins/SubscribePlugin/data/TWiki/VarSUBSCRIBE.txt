   * =%<nop>SUBSCRIBE{...}%= or simply =%<nop>SUBSCRIBE%=
| *Parameter* | *Default* | *Meaning* |
| =who= | Logged-in user | Who to subscribe (wikiname, no web) |
| =topic= | Current topic | Topic to subscribe to. Wildcards may be used e.g. =topic="Item*"= will subscribe to all topics starting with =Item=. Use =topic="Main.*"= to subscribe to the !WebNotify for that web. |
| =unsubscribe= | Not set | If set to "on", will *unsubscribe* the user |
| =format= | Simple HTML Link with an action anchor "Subscribe" or "Unsubscribe" | Defines custom look-and-feel for subscribe link using the following format variables: =$topics=, =$url=, =$wikiname=, =$action= |
| =formatunsubscribe= | =format= | Serves same function as =format=, but allows the user to define a different format than =subscribe=. |

   * The button toggles subscribe/unsubscribe if the user is already subscribed or vice versa. So after the next click on the button, the user will be unsubscribed.
   * The plugin will do the best it can to optimise the subscription lists in WebNotify.
