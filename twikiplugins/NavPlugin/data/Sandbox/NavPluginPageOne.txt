This is page one of the NavPluginExample.

Each page in the document set must have the DOCNAME variable defined.

It can defined in an HTML comment so that it's not visible.

The DOCNAME should be set to the base document name, such as "NavPlugin."  The plugin source code will automatically append "Index" to this name. 

	* Set DOCNAME = NavPlugin

<!--  also, it can be hidden
	* Set DOCNAME = NavPlugin
-->
