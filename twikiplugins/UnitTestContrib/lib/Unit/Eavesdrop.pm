Duplication of STDOUT and STDERR from tests to a (single) log file. Lets
you log everything printed on streams to another stream.

Author: Crawford Currie, http://c-dot.co.uk

Usage:

my $logfile = 'test.log';
open(F, ">$logfile");
my $stdout = new Unit::Eavesdrop('STDOUT', \*F);
my $stderr = new Unit::Eavesdrop('STDERR', \*F);
print STDERR "Foo\n";
print STDOUT "Bar\n";
close(F);
