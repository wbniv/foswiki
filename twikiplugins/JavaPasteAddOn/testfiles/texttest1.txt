"To be, or not to be,--that is the question:-- 
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer 
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune 
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, 
And by opposing end them?" 

--From Hamlet, Prince of Denmark - 1601 - Act III. - Scene 1. - Rows: 56-61 

Perhaps the most famous soliloquy in literature,
these words reflect the state of desperation in which Hamlet, 
the Prince of Denmark, finds himself as he contemplates suicide. 
His father, the King, has died. His mother, the Queen, 
has remarried within a month of the King's passing, an act which 
has disturbed young Hamlet in and of itself. To make it worse, 
she has married the King's brother, Hamlet's uncle, who is now 
the King of Denmark. As Hamlet's despair deepens, he learns 
(through the appearance of an apparition of his dead father) 
that the old King was murdered by the new King. 

Hamlet's growing awareness of the betrayal of his mother and evil of 
Claudius leads to a deepening depression and madness. This soliloquy 
contains the famous words "Thus conscience does make cowards of us all", 
hinting that the "dread of something after death"-purgatory, hell, perhaps-is 
what keeps Hamlet alive to avenge his father.
