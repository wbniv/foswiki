---+ Adverts TWiki Plugin

This plugin provides a convenient interface to http://phpadsnew.com

---++ Syntax Rules

Adverts are picked by selection strings, as per the phpAdsNew user manual.

It implements a %ADVERT and a %ADVERTRIJS - these both map to <nop>PhpAdsNew Remote Invocation <nop>JavaScript system. The other invocation methods are not supported.

Here is an extract (from page 73) of that manual, containing some of handy examples:

Below you will find examples of how the selection string could be configured.
The examples include different statements, logical operators and multiple expressions.
