---++ Description
This plugin helps rendering tag clouds.
From Wikipedia:Tag_cloud

<div style="margin:20px;font-style:italic">
A Tag Cloud is a text-based depiction of tags across a body of content to show
frequency of tag usage and enable topic browsing. In general, the more commonly
used tags are displayed with a larger font or stronger emphasis. Each term in
the tag cloud is a link to the collection of items that have that tag. 
</div>

Tag clouds give a very quick overview of the distribution of terms within a 
document base. This can be used to support navigation or just to display the
characteristics of the given data. Tag clouds are quite common in blog archives
where you can click on a tag in the cloud and list all postings that are 
tagged that way. Tag clouds can be generated on any list of terms that don't 
need to be "tags" in the more stricter sense, though the name of the figure
is still "tag cloud".

---++ How tag clouds are computed
Computing the tag cloud is done by counting the occurrences of the terms in the
input data. 

First, the input data has to be tokenized and normalized to match each word in
the input to a term by 
   1 splitting up the data, removing special characters,
   1 mapping different terms on one term, like handling synonyms
    (e.g. twikiapps=<nop>TWikiApplication)
    (optional)
   1 filtering unwanted words; there's a predefined list of (english) stop
     words that can applied
   1 mapping plural to singular word forms (done rudimentarily for english
     only)

Once all terms have been counted they are mapped into a fixed set of _buckets_.
For example given 102 different terms have been counted and ordered by
frequency, they are mapped into a set of -- let's say -- 30 buckets that are
containing those terms. Each term is assigned a _weight_, that is the ID of
the bucket it has been sorted in. 

In general the tag cloud renders the more frequent terms bolder
and/or more colorful than the less frequent. See [[#Example][the exmaple below]].  But you
are free to configure any variation of the appearance of a tag depending on its
frequency.  

---++ Syntax Rules
*Syntax*: 
<verbatim>
%TAGCLOUD{(terms=)"<term-list>" ... }%
</verbatim>

renders a tag cloud given a list of terms from which the term frequencies are extracted.
There are a couple of options that infulence the way the list of terms is tokenized
and processed, as well as the appearance of the resulting tag cloud.

Parameters:
   * =terms=: input data, a list of terms; a term can have the form =term:weight= whereas the
     ocurrence of this term is counted with the given weight
   * =split=: regular expression used to split up the input data 
     (default: =[/,\.?\s]+=)
   * =stopwords=: switch on/off filtering common (english) stop words
     (default: off)
   * =filter=: regular expression of characters to be filtered out; possible values
     are 'on': to remove a predefined set of special chars, 'off' don't filter at all
     or an arbitrary string of characters to be replaced with a single space; default value
     is 'off'
   * =exclude=: regular expression of terms to exclude from the tag cloud
     (default: undefined)
   * =include=: regular expression of terms that should be included
     (default: undefined)
   * =buckets=: number of buckets which to sort terms into
     (default: 10)
   * =sort=: sort terms in the tag cloud alphabetically or by weight (alpha or weight)
     (default: alpha)
   * =group=: format string to distinguish groups within the sortion; if the tag cloud is
     sorted alphabetically terms are groupd according their first letter; terms sorted by
     weight are groupd by their weight collected in tenner chunks. That is terms with
     a weight 1-10 are put in group "10", terms with a weight 11-20 are in "20" and so on;
     the current group displayed by replacing the pseudo variable
     =$group= in it; example: group="&lt;b>$group&lt;/b>" (default: &lt;empty>)
   * =reverse=: rever the sorting (on or off)
     (default: off)
   * =min=: minimum times a term must occur to be included in the tag cloud 
   * =offset=: integer value that is added to the weight number of a term
     (default: 10)
   * =lowercase=: switch on/off converting terms to lowercase
     (default: off)
   * =plural=: switch on/off counting plurals, if set to off plural terms are matched
     to their singular form (caution: very rudimentary and assuming the input data is all english, 
     use stopwords="on" to get good results)
   * =map=: list of terms to be normalized as synonyms; the format of this is: 
     "from1=to1,from2=to2,..."  Each occurrence of =from1= will be mapped to =to1= etc, and counted
     as such
   * =header=: format string to precede the output
   * =format=: format string for each tag in the tag cloud
   * =sep(arator)=: format string to be put between each tag in the cloud
   * =footer=: format string appended to the output
   * =warn=: switch on/off warning if no term was found 
     (default: on)

Format strings (=terms=, =header=, =format=, =sep= and =footer=)
might contain the following pseudo variables:
   * =$index=: the number of the tag in the (sorted) tag cloud
   * =$term=: the term itself
   * =$weight=: the term weight (that is: bucket + offset)
   * =$count=: the number the term has been counted
   * =$fadeRGB(startRed,startGreen,startBlue,endRed,endGreen,endBlue)= color of the term
     given its current weight in a color gradient defined by the given 6 integer values;
     returns a string =rgb(red,green,blue)= that can be used in a css color property
   * =$percnt=: expands to =%=
   * =$dollar=: expands to =$=
   * =$n=: expands to a linefeed
   * =$nop=: is removed from the format string
   * =$group=: grouping format string, see above

---++ Example

Cloud for the above text:

*You type*:
<verbatim>
%TAGCLOUD{"$percntINCLUDE{\"%WEB%.%TOPIC%\"}$percnt"
  header="<div style=\"text-align:center; padding:15px;line-height:180%\">"
  format="<span style=\"font-size:$weightpx;line-height:90%\"><a style=\"color:$fadeRGB(104,144,184,0,102,255);text-decoration:none\" title=\"$count\">$term</a></span>"
  footer="</div>"
  buckets="40"
  offset="12"
  lowercase="on"
  stopwords="on"
  plural="off"
  min="2"
  map="bucket=pail"
}%
</verbatim>

<div style="%IF{"context TagCloudPluginEnabled" then="display:none"}%">
*You get* (faked):
<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/TagCloud.jpg" alt="TagCloud" width="567" height="205" />
</div>

<div style="%IF{"context TagCloudPluginEnabled" else="display:none"}%">
*You get* (if installed):
%TAGCLOUD{"$percntINCLUDE{\"%WEB%.%TOPIC%\"}$percnt"
  header="<div style=\"padding:15px;text-align:center;line-height:180%\">"
  format="<span style=\"font-size:$weightpx;line-height:90%\"><a style=\"color:$fadeRGB(104,144,184,0,102,255);text-decoration:none\" title=\"$count\">$term</a></span>"
  footer="</div>"
  buckets="40"
  offset="12"
  lowercase="on"
  stopwords="on"
  plural="off"
  min="2"
  map="bucket=pail"
