%TOC%

A replacement for some of !EditTablePlugin, some of !EditTablerowPlugin and
some of !TablePlugin. Features:
   1 You can edit one row at a time, instead of having to edit the entire
     table. This solves the problem with the long page rendering times
     required to show all the HTML for a full table edit on big tables.
   1 Row being edited can be presented horizontally, as with !EditTablePlugin,
     or Form-style, like !EditTablerowPlugin. Makes it easier to edit very
     wide tables.
   1 Supports footer rows.
   1 Supports sorting columns in tables using Javascript, avoiding the
     round-trip to the server required by !TablePlugin. Can fall back to
     !TablePlugin if Javascript isn't available.
   1 Simple interface to moving rows around in the table, deleting and
     adding rows.
   1 Gets row numbering right (takes account of headers).
   1 It's faster than the individual plugins it replaces.
   1 (geeky) Coded using a clean object-oriented architecture, which
     makes it easily extensible.
   1 (geeky) Uses a simple REST interface for saving changes, which allows
     Javascript table editors to use the same interface to save.


---++ Usage

Works like the !EditTablePlugin (it uses exactly the same =%EDITTABLE= tags)
and you can use it to edit the entire table, or just one row at a time.

Add =%<nop>EDITTABLE{...}%= on the line before the first row of an existing table to make it editable. Parameters:

   * ==format== - The format of the cells in a row of the table. The format is
     defined like a table row, where the cell data specify the type for each
     cell. For example, =format="| text,16 | label |"=. Cells can be any of
     the following types:
      * =text, &lt;size&gt;, &lt;initial value&gt;= Simple text field. Initial value is optional.
      * =textarea, &lt;rows&gt;x&lt;columns&gt;, &lt;initial value&gt;=
        Multirow text box. Initial value is optional.
      * =select, &lt;size&gt;, &lt;option 1&gt;, &lt;option 2&gt;, etc=
        Select one from a list of choices.
      * =radio, &lt;size&gt;, &lt;option 1&gt;, &lt;option 2&gt;,= etc.
        Radio buttons. =size=
        indicates the number of buttons per line in edit mode.
      * =checkbox, &lt;size&gt;, &lt;option 1&gt;, &lt;option 2&gt;, etc=
        Checkboxes. =size=
        indicates the number of buttons per line in edit mode.
      * =label, 0, &lt;label text&gt;= Fixed label.
      * =row= The row number, automatically worked out.
      * =date, &lt;size&gt;, &lt;initial value&gt;, &lt;DHTML date format&gt;= Date. Initial value and date format are both optional.
   * ==changerows== - Rows can be added and removed if ="on"=. Rows can be
     added but not removed if ="add"=. Defaults to the value of the
     [[%SYSTEMWEB%.TWikiVariables][preference]] =CHANGEROWS=, or =off= if it isn't set.
   * ==disable== - By default, the plugin shows both full table and individual row editing controls. You can choose to disable one or both of these modes using the =disable= parameter, by setting it to =row= or =full= (or =row,full= to disable all editing and just leave sorting). If full table editing is disabled, but =changerows= is =on=, then the <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/edittable.gif" /> (edit table) button will be replaced with a <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/addrow.gif" /> (add row) button. Defaults to the value of the
     [[%SYSTEMWEB%.TWikiVariables][preference]] =EDITROWPLUGIN_DISABLE=, or =none= if it isn't set.
   * ==quietsave== - Quiet Save button is shown if ="on"=. Defaults to the
     value of the [[%SYSTEMWEB%.TWikiVariables][preference]] =QUIETSAVE=, or =off= if it
     isn't set.
   * ==include== -
     Name of another topic defining the EDITTABLE parameters. The first
     %<nop>EDITTABLE% in the topic is used. This is useful if you have many
     topics with the same table format and you want to update the format in
     one place.
   * ==headerrows== -
     Number of rows to treat as headers. Header rows are not 
     editable, and will not be sorted. =headerislabel= is also 
     supported for EditTablePlugin compatibility (equivalent 
     to =headderrows="1"=) |
   * ==header== -
     Specify the single-row header format of a new table. For example,
     ="%VBAR%*Food*%VBAR%*Drink*%VBAR%"=. Provided for compatibility with
     EditTablePlugin, not recommended.
   * ==footerrows== -
     Number of rows to treat as footers. Footer rows are not 
     editable and will not be sorted. |
   * ==orientrowedit== -
     unique to !EditRowPlugin, this parameter controls the 
     orientation of a row when it is being edited. It can be
     set to =horizontal= (the default) or =vertical=, which
     will present the columns of the row as rows in the editor. This makes
     editing very wide tables much easier. Has no effect in whole table
     editing mode.
   * ==helptopic== Topic name containing help text shown when editing a table. The [[VarSTARTINCLUDE][%<nop>STARTINCLUDE%]] and [[VarSTOPINCLUDE][%<nop>STOPINCLUDE%]] markers can be used in the topic to specify what is shown. Note that newlines are removed from the included text so the that text can be used inside a TWiki table.

Table rows are shown with a row edit button %ICON{edittopic}% in the first column,
and a table edit button <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/edittable.gif" /> after the
table. When the table is
edited, then a number of buttons may be shown depending on the
settings of =changerows= and =quietsave=.
   * %ICON{save}% saves the changes
   * <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/quiet.gif" /> saves without notification
   * %ICON{plus}% adds a new row after the current row, taking for its contents whatever you entered into the current row
   * %ICON{minus}% deletes the row
   * %ICON{arrowup}% Move this row up one row in the table
   * %ICON{arrowdown}% Move this row down one row in the table
   * %ICON{stop}% cancels the open edit

Copy the following examples and paste them into a topic in the Sandbox web
(or another web where you have write access). The !EditRowPlugin is
%IF{"{Plugins}{EditRowPlugin}{Enabled}"
else=" *not* enabled in this TWiki, so the examples will be disabled."
then="enabled in this TWiki. Click on the buttons to try it out."}%

%EDITTABLE{ format="| text,100 | text,100 |" orientrowedit="vertical" headerislabel="on"}%

---++ Preferences
The plugin interprets a couple of [[%SYSTEMWEB%.TWikiVariables][preferences]], in common with the !EditTablePlugin.
| =QUIETSAVE= | Gives a default value for the =quietsave= parameter. Default is =off=. |
| =CHANGEROWS= | Gives a default value for the =changerows= parameter. Default is =off=. |
Also, the plugin can be selectively disabled using
| =EDITROWPLUGIN_DISABLE= | Set to =on= to disable the plugin. Default is =off=. |
These preferences can be defined in %USERSWEB%.TWikiPreferences, in !WebPreferences for an individual web, or in the topic.

---++ Relationships
---+++ !EditTablePlugin
At this time most features of !EditTablePlugin are supported. Known exceptions
are:
   * the =editbutton= parameter,
   * the =EDITCELL= feature,
   * Plugin preferences (though global preferences are compatible)
---+++ !TablePlugin
Javascript sorting in !EditRowPlugin is much faster than !TablePlugin. However
!TablePlugin has many features this plugin does not support. The two plugins
can safely be used together.
---+++ !EditTablerowPlugin
Provides the vertical row editing interface like
!EditTablerowPlugin, with the row being edited shown in context in the table.

---++ Installation Instructions

%$INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS%

---++ Using the REST interface
The plugin saves changes to tables via a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer][REST]] handler. Javascript developers may find
this interface useful when developing their own tools that
manipulate tables.

The REST handler is invoked using the following URI format:

&lt;twiki-bin-path>/rest/EditRowPlugin/save

The handler accepts the following parameters:
   * =erp_active_topic= the web.wikiname of the topic to be changed
   * =erp_active_table= the table to be changed (numbered from 1)
   * =erp_active_row= - the row to be changed (numbered from 1, or -1 for the whole table)
   * =erp_active_format= - the =format= parameter from the =EDITTABLE= tag
   * =erp_save.x= - if nonzero, this is a save
   * =erp_quietSave.x= - if nonzero, this is a quietsave
   * =erp_upRow.x= - if nonzero, this is a row move
   * =erp_downRow.x= - if nonzero, this is a  row move
   * =erp_deleteRow.x= - if nonzero, this is a row deletion
   * =erp_cancel.x= - if nonzero, this is a cancel
   * =erp_noredirect= - if set, suppresses the redirect and gets a status code instead
The value of each individual cell is stored in a parameter called =erp_&lt;table>_&lt;row>_&lt;column>=
