---+!! JoomlaUsersContrib Contrib Package

*REQUIRES TWiki 4.2 later, and tested with Joomla 1.0.13*


This Contrib enables you to replace the TWiki User and Groups system with a read only access to the User and Groups in a [[http://www.joomla.org/][Joomla]] Database. Registration of new users and their association with Groups is then _only_ handled by Joomla, making it possible to remove the distributed Main web.

You are advised to use the same same host for TWiki and the Joomla Database, otherwise user query performance (happens every request) will severely degrade the response time.

*NOTE:* for performance reasons, the Joomla Registered Users group is _not_ brought into the system, The other groups may cause performance degradation if they have too many members

By selecting JoomlaLogin, TWiki will also attempt to use the Joomla 'remember me' cookie - though this requires the TWiki and Joomla host names to be the same.
