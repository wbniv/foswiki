---++ Summary of Contents

This module supports structured queries over a database built on the fly from the forms in TWiki topics. It does not support any tags, as it is provided as a service for other plugins that want to treat a TWiki web as a simple database; for example, the TWiki:Plugins/FormQueryPlugin, which supports the display of query results.

The plugin encapsulates code that was formerly in the "engine room" of the FormQueryPlugin. It has been abstracted out in the belief that it will be useful to anyone who wants to do simple search operations from a plugin.

---+++ Features
	* Perform complex queries on the TWiki database
	* Cache TWiki topics for rapid queries

---+++ How the database gets built
You can think of the database as an array of all the topics in a web. Each array entry is a map (or hash in perl terms) that maps a set of field names to values.

Each topic in the web automatically gets a number of standard fields, generated by reading the metadata from the topic (see %SYSTEMWEB%.TWikiMetaData)
	* =name=        - name of the topic
	* =parent=      - name of parent topic
	* =_up=         - _reference_ to the Map of the parent topic, if it exists
	* =attachments= - array of Maps, each of which contains:
		*  =_up= - _reference_ to the Map for the topic
		*  =name= - attachment name
		* =attr= - e.g hidden
		* =comment= - attachment comment
		* =path= - client path used to upload attachment
		* =size= - size in Kb
		* =user= - who uploaded the attachment
		* =version= - e.g. 1.3
	* =info= - Map containing:
		* =_up= - reference to the Map for the topic
		* =author= - most recent author
		* =date= - date of last change
		* =format= - topic format version
		* =version= - topic version number
	* =moved= - Map containing:
		* =_up= - reference to the Map for the topic
		* =by= - who moved it
		* =date= - when they moved it
		* =from= - where they moved it from
		* =to= - where they moved it to
	* =form= - form type
	*  _form name_ - e.g. if a "My<nop>Form" is attached, this will be =My<nop>Form=. This is a reference to a Map containing a key for each field in the form. Each key maps to the value in the form data for that key. The Map will also have an =_up= reference to the Map for the topic.
	* =text= - raw text of the topic)

The sub-Maps created for =info=, _form name_, =moved=, and each row in =attachments= also have a _reference_ back to the topic Map, called  =_up=.

Other fields may be added by subclasses. Refer to the documentation for the plugin that is using the DBCache for more details.

---+++ The cache
To achieve best perfomance the plugin caches the database read from the TWiki topics. The cache is stored in the work area for the DBCacheContrib (see ={RCS}{WorkAreaDir}= in =configure=). If any topic changes in the web, this cache is automatically rebuilt. The cache file can be deleted at any point with no ill effects.
---+++ Extending or customising
Extension or customisation is welcome, as long as all extensions are described and code provided back to the author.

The module is shipped with a perl build file, which should be used for installation and testing. Testing is done using CPAN:Test::Unit, and is invoked using the 'test' build target. Writing tests is a useful way of feeding back bugs as well. I can't encourage you enough to maintain and extend the tests!
---++ Detailed Documentation
Clients use the DBCache by defining a subclass of the =TWiki::Contrib::DBCacheContrib= class. The following POD documentation describes the methods of this class and the various other classes provided by the plugin..

---++ Installation Instructions
<div class="twikiAlert">
Note: if you are upgrading from a pre-13527 version, you __must__ run =configure= after you have installed. Specifically, the ={DBCacheContrib}{Archivist}= configuration option must have a value, or you will get a "No {DBCacheContrib}{Archivist}" error.
