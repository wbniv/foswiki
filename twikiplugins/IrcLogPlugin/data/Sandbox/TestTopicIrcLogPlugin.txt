<MartinCleaver> Trying to make the webs bar under the group bar only show the current web
<MartinCleaver> so that if someone wants to see all webs in the group they click on the group leader
<MartinCleaver> but when you are inside, you only see the one layer 
<MartinCleaver> hmm
<MartinCleaver> maybe this is the same thing as that feature you added for me a while back
<ColasNahaboo> interesting feature
<ColasNahaboo> I dont think it is possible now
<ColasNahaboo> let's see
<ColasNahaboo> on your http://mbawiki.com/bin/view/ClassNotes/WebHome
<ColasNahaboo> hum
<ColasNahaboo> let's see: http://koala.ilog.fr/wiki/bin/view/People/WebHome
<ColasNahaboo> you would want to have all your webs ClassNotes like KS_Slim
<ColasNahaboo> in the sub-sitemap
<ColasNahaboo> but not in the navbar
<MartinCleaver> url for KS_SLim?
<ColasNahaboo> http://koala.ilog.fr/wiki/bin/view/People/WebHome
* MartinCleaver clicks
<MartinCleaver> hmm. interesting but not what I meant!
<ColasNahaboo> it is done by HIDDEN
<MartinCleaver> I meant if I click on  http://koala.ilog.fr/wiki/bin/view/Colas/WebHome I don't want TKormann or SHillion to show in the webs bar
<MartinCleaver> I think you might have implemented this before, but for the life of me I can't fine it
<MartinCleaver> s/fine/find
<ColasNahaboo> then put HIDDEN to these webs (Tkormann & Shillion)
<MartinCleaver> but I want them to show when I click on people in the group bar
<ColasNahaboo> (sorry, phone)
<MartinCleaver> ok
<ColasNahaboo> back
<ColasNahaboo> here what you can habe: use NOTAB all subwebs
<ColasNahaboo> I did just this on Colas, Thierry, etc... subwebs of:
<ColasNahaboo> http://koala.ilog.fr/wiki/bin/view/People/WebHome
<ColasNahaboo> need to go, bye
