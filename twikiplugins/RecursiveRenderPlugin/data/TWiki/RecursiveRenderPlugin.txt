---+ RecursiveRenderPlugin

This plugin adds the ability to tell the TWiki renderer to render a portion of a page as if it were a page all to itself.

---++ Syntax Rules

There are two ways to use this plugin.

Syntax 1: <pre>&lt;render>Wiki Stuff&lt;/render></pre>
This will render =Wiki Stuff= as if it were its own page, and render the rest of the page as if it were a single word.  So a =&lt;render&gt;= block is valid in a table cell, or in any other context, even if you normally could not put other wiki markup in that location.

Syntax 2: 
<verbatim>
~macro
This is a macro definition.
	* This is a list inside the macro.
	* For demonstration purposes.
~~
| This is a macro usage: <br /> ~macro |
</verbatim>
Produces:
<table border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="0">
<tr><td> This is a macro usage: <br /> This is a macro definition.

<ul>
<li> This is a list inside the macro.
</li>
<li> For demonstration purposes.
</li>
</ul></td></tr>
</table>

---++ <nop>%TOPIC% Global Settings

	* One line description, shown in the %SYSTEMWEB%.TextFormattingRules topic:
		* Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = This plugin adds =&lt;render&gt;= tags and =~macros=.

	* Debug plugin: (See output in =data/debug.txt=)
		* Set DEBUG = 0
