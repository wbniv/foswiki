This is a simple Tracking System implemented using TWiki.TWikiForms. It has been implemented to be used in a web on its own, but could be intermingled with a discussion style !TWikiWeb.

See http://develop.twiki.org/~develop/cgi-bin/view/Bugs for an example of it in use (though please don't change anything; it's a live Bug DB!)

The BugsContrib is a _TWikiApplication_ (an application that is implemented entirely in TWiki topics). It is designed to use the left bars supported by "pattern" skin, though could easily be converted to another skin. It's ideal for a small bug database (we have used it with over 2000 items with no problems) for a disciplined team.

---++ Installation

---+++ Installation Instructions

	* First, check that you do no have an existing web called "Bugs". if you do, move it out of the way.
	* Download the archive from the Plugins web (see below)
	* Unpack it in your twiki installation directory. Content:
     | *File:* | *Description:* |
%$MANIFEST%
	* Make sure that all files are readable by the web server user
	* Run =perl= ==%TOPIC%_installer.pl== =install= to automatically check and install other TWiki modules that this module depends on, that you may not have installed. This script also includes an =uninstall= option should you ever wish to remove the plugin from your installation, and an =upgrade= option that will automatically download and install the latest version.

See the Bugs.WebHome topic in the new web for help in configuring the application to your needs.
