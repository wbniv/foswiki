All Items should be SMART. that means the reports must
   1 Be clear enough that anyone can take a stab at solving the problem
   1 Have a clear statement of what is required to be able to close them ("this must work")
   1 Have individual names associated with the report and with the fixing process
   1 Be realistic (obvious, really)
   1 Be timeframed
