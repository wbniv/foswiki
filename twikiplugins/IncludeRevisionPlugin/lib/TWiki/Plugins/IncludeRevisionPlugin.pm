# =========================
#
# This is an empty TWiki plugin. Use it as a template
# for your own plugins; see TWiki.TWikiPlugins for details.
#
# Each plugin is a package that contains the subs:
#
#   initPlugin           ( $topic, $web, $user, $installWeb )
#   commonTagsHandler    ( $text, $topic, $web )
#   startRenderingHandler( $text, $web )
#   outsidePREHandler    ( $text )
#   insidePREHandler     ( $text )
#   endRenderingHandler  ( $text )
#
# initPlugin is required, all other are optional. 
# For increased performance, all handlers except initPlugin are
# disabled. To enable a handler remove the leading DISABLE_ from
# the function name.
# 
# NOTE: To interact with TWiki use the official TWiki functions
# in the &TWiki::Func module. Do not reference any functions or
# variables elsewhere in TWiki!!


# =========================
package TWiki::Plugins::IncludeRevisionPlugin; 	# change the package name!!!

# =========================
use vars qw(
        $web $topic $user $installWeb $VERSION $RELEASE $debug

# This should always be $Rev: 6827 $ so that TWiki can determine the checked-in
# status of the plugin. It is used by the build automation tools, so
# you should leave it alone.
