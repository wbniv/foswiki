---+ <nop>%TOPIC%

Simple plugin to display weather information for a specific location. It uses [[http://search.cpan.org/~schnueck/Weather-Com-0.1/lib/Weather/Com.pm][Weather::Com]] and requires a free Weather.com subscription (see the Weather::Com manpage).

---++ Syntax Rules

	* %<nop>WEATHER{City, Country}%
	* %<nop>WEATHER{Citycode}%

---++ Examples

	* %<nop>WEATHER{Zurich, Switzerland}%
	* %<nop>WEATHER{GMXX0040}%

---++ Bugs
	* Yes!
	* The citycode is only necessary in case you have some non-alphabetic chars in your string, e.g =Frankfurt/Main=. I didn't manage to get =Weather::Com= parse that. So if you have more than one cities with the same name in the country, you'd rather take the city code. Feel free to fix that :-)	

---++ Plugin Settings

Plugin settings are stored as preferences variables. To reference a plugin setting write ==%<nop>&lt;plugin&gt;_&lt;setting&gt;%==, i.e. ==%<nop>INTERWIKIPLUGIN_SHORTDESCRIPTION%==

		* Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Displays nice weather graphics for a specific location

	* Partner ID and License Key (Get them from Weather.com, see Weather::Com manpage (Free of charge))
