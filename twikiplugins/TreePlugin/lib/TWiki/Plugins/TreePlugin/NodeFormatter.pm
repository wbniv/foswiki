package TWiki::Plugins::TreePlugin::NodeFormatter;

=pod

Superclass for node types. Formatting functions are implemented by subclasses.

=cut

sub new { }

sub initNode { _unimplemented( "initNode", @_ ); }

sub formatNode { _unimplemented( "formatNode", @_ ); }

sub formatChild { _unimplemented( "formatChild", @_ ); }

sub formatBranch { _unimplemented( "formatBranch", @_ ); }

sub closeBranch {
    my ( $this, $text ) = @_;
    return $text;
}

sub _unimplemented {
    my $routine = shift;
    my $class   = shift;
    die "$routine not implemented for $class with params ("
      . join( ", ", @_ ) . ")";
}

=pod

Checks if the current level is within bounds set by startlevel and stoplevel.

=cut

sub isInsideLevelBounds {
    my ( $this, $level ) = @_;
	
	return 1 if not defined $level;
         
    return 0 if ( $level < $this->data("startlevel") );

    return 0 if ( $level > $this->data("stoplevel") );

    return 1; 
}

=pod

Checks if the current level is within one count to bounds set by startlevel and stoplevel. Used to properly close lists.

Might not be the best way to solve this problem.

=cut

sub isOneOffLevelBounds {
    my ( $this, $level ) = @_;
	
	return 1 if not defined $level;

    return 0 if ( $level < ($this->data("startlevel") - 1) );

    return 0 if ( $level > ($this->data("stoplevel") + 1) );

    return 1; 
}

1;
