---+ Header of User Homepages

__Note:__ This is a maintenance topic, used by the TWiki administrator.

The part between the horizontal rules gets included at the top of every %WIKIUSERSTOPIC% homepage. The header can be customized to the needs of your organization. For example, show all frequently used fields from the UserForm on top, followed by a personalized portal. The portal can pull content from other places, such as headline news by department, a list of current projects, etc. The TWiki:TWiki.UserHomepageSupplement has some additional documentation and ideas on customizing the homepages.
