---+ Benchmark Contrib Package

Web/TWiki based performance measurement tool for TWiki

%TOC%

%X% *Note:* The contrib is in early alpha state.  The feature set and
the documentation may change radically without a notice (with
exception of the usual Bugs/SVN announcement).  If we're lucky then
documentation and code will keep in sync. :-)

Before the contrib is distributed on twiki.org (if we need that at
all, given that developers are using SVN right away), feedback in
TWiki:Codev.BenchmarkFramework is highly appreciated.

---++ Summary of Contents

This contrib is intended to be used mainly by developers, which is
quite typical for a "contrib" as opposed to plugins.  But unlike many
contribs it is not centered around an API.  It is used by filling a
form, like a a TWiki Application.  But unlike those it brings its own
Perl modules, and might even require to install some extra CPAN
modules which are not needed for "normal" TWiki operation.

This is the autogenerated module documentation, as usual for
contribs.  If you want to just run benchmarks, please refer to the
BenchmarkContribUserGuide.

---++ Settings

Settings are stored as preferences variables. To reference a setting write ==%<nop>&lt;plugin&gt;_&lt;setting&gt;%==, e.g. ==%<nop>%TOPIC%_STUB%==

%TOPIC% does not (yet) have any settings which need to be (or are
worth to be) customized.
