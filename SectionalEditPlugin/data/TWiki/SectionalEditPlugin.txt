---++ Sectional Edit Plugin
_Discussion of this plugin can be found in [[TWiki:Plugins.%TOPIC%Dev][%TOPIC%Dev]]._

This plugin allows the user to break a topic into sections which can be edited individually.

%X% There is a known problem in that if the last character in a section is a TWiki markup, the markup will be rendered verbatim. Nevertheless, due to many requests I have put the plugin here without having addressed this final issue.

---+++ Syntax Rules

To enable editing of:
   * *One or more sections,* insert a =&lt;sectionbreak/&gt;= tag on the line above each  heading marker (=---+=) or deeper;
   * *Any portion of a topic,* enclose that portion between =&lt;sectionedit&gt;= and =&lt;/sectionedit&gt;= tags;
   * *The entire topic,* insert the =&lt;editsections/&gt;= tag on the first line of the topic; or
   * *On all topics, by default,* set the preference flag =EDITSECTIONS= to true (in either user or web preferences). With this approach, the preference variable =SECTIONDEPTHMIN= and =SECTIONDEPTH= (again set in either user or web) controls the level of headings down to which SectionalEditPlugin will apply (with all lower headings/sections being included in that section); the former skips lower-level headings from sectioning. If =SECTIONDEPTH= is undefined or =all=, all levels of headings create sections. If =SECTIONDEPTHMIN= is undefined or =0=, a section is created also for the text preceeding the first encountered section.
      * SECTIONDEPTH = all
      * SECTIONDEPTHMIN = 1
      * %X% I do not recommend turning sectional editing on globally, as this will also section topics that might not be desired to be presented in this form, e.g., email reports about web changes, various searches, etc. A much better approach is to put the =&lt;editsections/&gt;= tag into a custom template and apply it to a topic by setting the =VIEW_TEMPLATE= for topic, web, or site.

*NOTE:* You *cannot* mix these three methods on a single page.

*NOTE:* This breaks the page up at the lowest level, meaning that you can't put section breaks inside tables, lists, etc. as it breaks the whole page up into a table.

---+++ <nop>%TOPIC% Settings

   * One line description, is shown in the %SYSTEMWEB%.TextFormattingRules topic:
      * Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Allows the user to break a topic into sections for individual editing.

   * Debug plugin: (See output in =data/debug.txt=)
      * Set DEBUG = 0

   * Edit Label (may also be an =&lt;img&gt;= tag):
      * Set LABEL = Edit

   * A comma separated list of skins *NOT* to section (you'll probably want the print skin here):
      * Set SKIPSKIN = print, plain

   * Style for marking sections. This is either an inline style definition or a class reference. If left blank, a bar of BGCOLOR is placed next to the sections that can be edited. Style definitions may also be placed with the =&lt;sectionedit&gt;= tag to give individual sections a different style.
      * Set STYLE = style="border: black thin dotted"
      * #Set STYLE = class="twikiTopicActions"
      * #Set STYLE = 

   * Placement of the Edit Label (below or above, only valid together with the STYLE setting)
      * Set PLACEMENT = below

   * Justification of Edit Label (left or right)
      * Set JUSTIFICATION = right

   * Edit Bar Background Color:
      * Set BGCOLOR = silver
