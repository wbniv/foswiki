Description: Verify that TWiki:Codev.AddSectionParam is working

This is really ugly - could be improved only if including URLs is
allowed (which it isn't, per default).

%X% *Update:* This test topic is semi-obsolete as there exists a unit
test now: =test/unit/ViewParamSection.pm= .  This unit test needs the
"beta quality" Foswiki:Extensions.CliRunnerContrib, so it is not yet part
of the standard suite.

Additional Test Topic: IncludeFixtures, as stolen from TestCaseSectionalInclude.

Compare the middle column (as obtained from including a section) with
the result of clicking on the link in the right column.  Ouch.
