---+ Wiki Administrator User

The %TOPIC% has been added to TWiki 4.2.0 to make it possible to login without needing to create a TWiki User,
or to temporarily login as %TOPIC% using the password set in configure, and then log back out to the same User and Group as before.

This means it is no longer necessary to add yourself to the WikiAdminGroup, and you will be able to quicky
change to Admin User (and back to your user) only when you need to.

---+++ How to login as %TOPIC%
   * Login as the internal Wiki administrator:
      * %ADMINLOGIN%
   * Logout from Administrator:
      * click the [[%LOGOUTURL%][Logout link]]

__%X% NOTE:__ If you lock yourself out of <nop>WikiAdminUser during setup activities or have forgotten the configure password,
you can unset the configure password by editing the =lib/LocalSite.cfg= file and deleting the line that starts
with =$TWiki::cfg{Password}= and then set it again by saving your settings in =configure=.
%ENDSECTION{"sudo_login"}%

---+++ Prerequisites
   * =Security Setup : Sessions : {UserClientSession}= needs to be enabled in configure
   * a configure password (otherwise the Admin login is automatically disabled.)
   * If your TWiki is configured to use !ApacheLoginManager, you will need to log in as a valid user first.
