---+ CGI and Command Line Scripts

_Programs on the server performing actions such as rendering, saving and renaming topics._

These scripts are located in the =bin= and =tools= directories. This topic describes the interfaces to some of those scripts. All scripts in the =twiki/bin= directory can be called from the CGI ([[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface][Common Gateway Interface]]) environment or from the command line. The scripts in the =twiki/tools= directory can only be called from the command line.

%TOC%

---++ CGI Scripts
Details on CGI scripts located in the =twiki/bin= directory.

---+++ General Information
---++++ CGI environment
In the CGI environment parameters are passed to the scripts via the URL and URL parameters. Environment variables are also used to determine the user performing the action. If the environment is not set up, the default user is used (usually =guest=).
---++++ Command-line
You *must* be have the =twiki/bin= directory on the perl path to run the scripts from the command line. To avoid issues with file permissions, run the scripts as the web server user such as =nobody= or =www=.

Parameters are passed on the command line using '-name' - for example,
<verbatim>
$ cd /usr/local/twiki/bin
$ save -topic MyWeb.MyTopic -user admin -action save -text "New text of the topic"
</verbatim>
All parameters require a value, even if that is the empty string.

---++++ Common parameters
All the scripts accept a number of common parameters. The first two components of the URL after the script name are taken as the web and the topic, respectively. Standard URL parameters are:

| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| =topic= | If this is set to a URL, %WIKITOOLNAME% will immediately redirect to that URL. Otherwise it overrides the URL and is taken as the topic name (you can pass Web.<nop>TopicName) | |
| =user= | Command-line only; set the name of the user performing the action. Note: this usage is inherently insecure, as it bypasses webserver login constraints. For this reason only authorised users should be allowed to execute scripts from the command line. | |
| =skin= | Overrides the default skin path (see [[Skins]]) | |
| =cover= | Specifies temporary skin path to prepend to the skin path for this script only (see [[Skins]]) | |
| =t= | While the =t= parameter is not actively used by any scripts, it is used throughout the links like =edit= to ensure that the browser doesn't cache the reply. | generally set to current time |

---+++ =attach=
Despite the name, this script doesn't actually attach a file to a topic - for that, use =upload=. This script is part of the transactions sequence executed when a file is uploaded from the browser. it just generates the "new attachment" page for a topic.

| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| =filename= | Name of existing attachment (if provided, this is a "manage attachment" action) | none (in which case this is a "new attachment" action) |

---+++ =changes=
Shows all the changes in the given web. 

The =changes= script can receive one parameter:

| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| =minor= | If 0, show only major changes. If 1, show all the changes (both minor and major) | 0 |

The main difference between invoking this script and using WebChanges is that WebChanges is based on a =%<nop>SEARCH%=, while this script reads the =changes= file in each web, making it much faster.

*NOTE*: The result from =changes= script and the topic WebChanges can be different, if the =changes= file is deleted from a web. In particular, in new installations the =changes= script will return no results while the WebChanges topic will.

---+++ =configure=
=configure= is the browser script used for inspection of, and cahnges to, the site configuration. None of the parameters to this script are useable for any purpose except =configure=. See [[%SCRIPTURLPATH{"configure"}%][configure]].

---+++ =edit=
The =edit= script understands the following parameters, typically supplied by HTML input fields:

| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| =action= | Optional. Use the editaction template instead of the standard edit. If action=text, then hide the form. If action=form hide the normal text area and only edit the form. You can change the Edit/Edit Raw buttons to always append the action parameter in skins like Pattern and Classic by setting the topic or [[preference setting]] [[VarEDITACTION][EDITACTION]] to the value =text= or =form=. To edit the topic once the EDITACTION is defined as form simply remove the action=form from the browser URL of the edit script and reload the edit window | |
| =onlynewtopic= | If set, error if topic already exists | |
| =onlywikiname= | If set, error if topic name is not a WikiWord | |
| =templatetopic= | The name of the template topic, copied to get the initial content (new topic _only_) | |
| =text= | Initial text for the topic | |
| =topicparent= | The parent topic | |
| =formtemplate= | Name of the form to instantiate in the topic. Overrides the form set in the =templatetopic= if defined. (will remove the form is set to 'none') | |
| =contenttype= | Optional parameter that defines the application type to write into the CGI header. Defaults to =text/html=. May be used to invoke alternative client applications | |
| =anyname= | Any parameter can passed to the new topic; if the template topic contains =%<nop>URLPARAM{"anyname"}%=, it will be replaced by its value | |
| =breaklock= | If set, any lease conflicts will be ignored, and the edit will proceed even if someone is already editing the topic. | |
| =redirectto= | If the user continues from edit to save, and if the save (or cancels the edit) process is successful, save will redirect to this topic or URL. The parameter value can be a =TopicName=, a =Web.TopicName=, or a URL.%BR% __Note:__ Redirect to a URL only works if it is enabled in =configure= (Miscellaneous ={AllowRedirectUrl}=). | |

Form field values are passed in parameters named 'field' - for example, if I have a field =Status= the parameter name is =Status=.
   1 The first sequence of ten or more =X= characters in the topic name will be converted on save to a number such that the resulting topic name is unique in the target web.

NOTE: most skins support the definition of =EDIT_SKIN=, which is used as the value of the =cover= parameter in =edit= URLs. This allows you to override the default edit skin on a web, topic or user basis.

---+++ =login=
Used for logging in with !TemplateLoginManager.
| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| =origurl= | URL that was being accessed when an access violation occurred. the login process will redirect to this URL if it is successful | none |
| =username= | username of user logging in | none |
| =password= | password of user logging in | none |

---+++ =logon=
Used for logging in when Web Server authentication is being used (e.g. !ApacheLoginManager). The script does nothing; it is purely a placeholder for triggering the login process. The webserver will be set up to require a valid user to access this script, thus triggering the webserver login process.
 
---+++ =manage=
Performs a range of management functions.
| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| =action= | One of =createweb=, =deleteUserAccount=, =editSettings= or =saveSettings= | none |

---++++ =action=createweb=
| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| =newweb= | Name of the new web | '' |
| =baseweb= | Name of the web to copy to create the new web | '' |
| =webbgcolor= | value for WEBBGCOLOR | '' |
| =sitemapwhat= | Value for SITEMAPWHAT | '' |
| =sitemapuseto= | Value for SITEMAPUSETO | '' |
| =nosearchall= | Value for NOSEARCHALL | '' |

---++++ =action=editSettings=
No parameters

---++++ =action=saveSettings=
| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| =text= | Text of the topic | '' |
| =originalrev= | Revision that the edit started on | Most recent revision |
| =redirectto= | If the savesettings process is successful, save will redirect to this topic or URL. The parameter value can be a =TopicName=, a =Web.TopicName=, or a URL.%BR% __Note:__ Redirect to a URL only works if it is enabled in =configure= (Miscellaneous ={AllowRedirectUrl}=). | 
All other parameters may be interpreted as form fields, depending on the current form definition in the topic.

---++++ =action=bulkRegister=
See BulkRegistration.
| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| =OverwriteHomeTopics= | Whether to overwrite existing home topics or not | false |
| =EmailUsersWithDetails= | Whether to mail registered users or not | false |
| =LogTopic= | Topic to save the log in | Same as topic name, with 'Result' appended. |

---++++ =action=changePassword=
Change password, email address, or both, of a user.
| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| =username= | god alone knows | _none_ |
| =oldpassword= | current password | _none_ |
| =password= | new password | _none_ |
| =passwordA= | new password confirmation | _none_ |
| =email= | new email address | _none_ |
=password, =passwordA= and =email= are optional. If neither or =password= and =passwordA= is set, then the user password is left unchanged. If =email= is unset, their email is left unchanged.

---++++ =action=resetPassword=
Reset the password for a single or multiple users
| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| =LoginName= | *list* of usernames to reset | none - error if not set |
| =Introduction= | message to be sent alongside the reset, most often used to announce to the user that they have been given an account.  | '' |

This is used by BulkResetPassword and ResetPassword. Only administrators can provide a list of LoginNames, non-admins can only provide a single LoginName. 

BulkRegistration provides the means to create multiple accounts but it does not announce those accounts to the users who own them. BulkResetPassword is used to assign the passwords, the Introduction is used to explain why they are receiving the mail.

---++++ =action=deleteUserAccount=
Unregisters (removes) the currently logged-in user.
| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| =password= | Users' password | none |

---+++ =oops=
This script is mainly used for rendering pages containing error messages, though it is also used for some functional actions such as manage pages (move topic etc).

=oops= templates are used with the =oops= script to generate system messages. This is done to make internationalisation or other local customisations simple. 

The =oops= script supports the following parameters:

| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| =template= | Name of the template file to display | |
| =def= | Optional, can be set to the name of a single definition within =template=. This definition will be instantiated in the =template= wherever =%<nop>INSTANTIATE%= is seen. This lets you use a single template file for many messages. For an example, see =oopsmanagebad.tmpl=. | |
| =paramN= | Where N is an integer from 1 upwards. These values will be substituted into =template= for =%<nop>PARAM1%= etc. | |

---+++ =preview=
This script is _deprecated_. Its functions are covered by the =save= script.

---+++ =rdiff=
Renders the differences between version of a topic

| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| rev1 | the higher revision | |
| rev2 | the lower revision | |
| render | the rendering style {sequential, sidebyside, raw, debug} | DIFFRENDERSTYLE, =sequential= |
| type | {history, diff, last} history diff, version to version, last version to previous | =diff= |
| context | number of lines of context | |
TODO:
   * add a {word} render style

---+++ =register=

| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| =action= | =register= or =verify= or =resetPassword= or =approve= | |

---+++ =rename=
Used for renaming topics.

| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| =skin= | skin(s) to use | |
| =newweb= | new web name | |
| =newtopic= | new topic name | |
| =breaklock= | | |
| =attachment= | | |
| =confirm= | if defined, requires a second level of confirmation | |
| =currentwebonly= | if defined, searches current web only for links to this topic | |
| =nonwikiword= | if defined, a non-wikiword is acceptable for the new topic name | |
| =redirectto= | If the rename process is successful, rename will redirect to this topic or URL. The parameter value can be a =TopicName=, a =Web.TopicName=, or a URL.%BR% __Note:__ Redirect to a URL only works if it is enabled in =configure= (Miscellaneous ={AllowRedirectUrl}=). | |

---+++ =rest=
This REST ([[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST][Representational State Transfer]]) script can be invoked via http in the same way as the other scripts (see *Invocation Examples*, below) to execute a function that is associated to a "subject" and a "verb" (see below). These functions are usually registered by plugins using the =TWiki::Func::registerRESTHandler= method. The =rest= script will print the result directly to the browser unless the =endPoint= parameter is specified, in which case it will output a redirect to the given topic.

The =rest= script supports the following parameters:
| =username= | If =TemplateLogin=, or a similar login manager not embedded in the web server, is used, then you need to pass a username and password to the server. The =username= and =password= parameters are used for this purpose. |
| =password= | See =username= |
| =topic= | If defined as the full name (including web) of a topic, then when the script starts up plugins will be passed this as the "current" topic. If not defined, then [[%USERSWEB%.%HOMETOPIC%]] will be passed to plugins. |
| =endPoint= | Where to redirect the response once the request is served, in the form "Web.Topic" |

The function is free to use any other query parameters for its own purposes.

%X% The =rest= script should *always* require authentication in any site that has logins. Otherwise there is a risk of opening up major security holes. So make sure you add it to the list of authenticated scripts if you are using =ApacheLogin=.

---++++ Invocation Examples

The =rest= script assumes that it will be called with URL in the form:

=http://my.host/bin/rest/&lt;subject&gt;/&lt;verb&gt;=

where =&lt;subject&gt;= must be the WikiWord name of one of the installed [[Plugins]], and the =&lt;verb&gt;= is the alias for the function registered using the =TWiki::Func::registerRESTHandler= method. The =&lt;subject&gt;= and =&lt;verb&gt;= are then used to lookup and call the registered function.

=&lt;subject&gt;= and =&lt;verb&gt;= are checked for illegal characters exactly in the same way as the web and topic names.

As an example, the EmptyPlugin has registered a function to be used with the =rest= script under the subject *EmptyPlugin* and the verb *example*. Click below to see the =rest= script in action (run as guest).

[[%SCRIPTURL{rest}%/EmptyPlugin/example?debugenableplugin=EmptyPlugin][Call the Plugin]]

Note that for Plugins to register REST handlers, they must be enabled in =configure=.

---+++ =save=
The =save= script performs a range of save-related functions, as selected by the =action= parameter.

| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| =action_save=1= | *default*; save, return to view, dontnotify is =off= | |
| =action_quietsave=1= | save, and return to view, =dontnotify= is =on= | |
| =action_checkpoint= | save and redirect to the edit script, =dontnotify= is =on= | |
| =action_cancel= | exit without save, return to view | |
| =action_preview= | preview edited text | |
| =action_addform= | Redirect to the "change form" page. | |
| =action_replaceform...= | Redirect to the "change form" page. | |
| =action_delRev= | *Administrators only* delete the most recent revision of the topic - all other parameters are ignored. You have to be an administrator to use this, and not all store implementations will support it. | |
| =action_repRev= | *Administrators only* replace the text of the most recent revision of the topic with the text in the =text= parameter. =text= must included embedded meta-data tags. All other parameters are ignored. You have to be an administrator to use this, and not all store implementations will support it. | |
| =onlynewtopic= | If set, error if topic already exists | |
| =onlywikiname= | If set, error if topic name is not a WikiWord | |
| =dontnotify= | if defined, suppress change notification | |
| =templatetopic= | Name of a topic to use as a template for the text and form (new topic _only_) | |
| =text= | New text of the topic | |
| =forcenewrevision= | if set, forces a revision even if %WIKITOOLNAME% thinks one isn't needed | |
| =topicparent= | If 'none' remove any current topic parent. If the name of a topic, set the topic parent to this. | |
| =formtemplate= | if defined, use the named template for the form (will remove the form is set to 'none') | |
| =editaction= | When action is =checkpoint=, =add form= or =replace form...=, this is used as the =action= parameter to the =edit= script that is redirected to after the save is complete. | |
| =originalrev= | Revision on which the edit started. | |
| =edit= | The script to use to edit the topic when action is =checkpoint= | =edit= |
| =editparams= | The parameter string to use to edit the topic |  |
| =redirectto= | The save process will redirect to this topic or URL if it is successful. (Typically this would be the URL that was being viewed when edit was invoked). The parameter value can be a =TopicName=, a =Web.TopicName=, or a URL.%BR% __Note:__ Redirect to a URL only works if it is enabled in =configure= (Miscellaneous ={AllowRedirectUrl}=). | view topic being edited |

Any errors will cause a redirect to an =oops= page.

The parameters are interpreted in according to the following rules.

   1 The first sequence of ten or more =X= characters in the topic name will be converted to a number such that the resulting topic name is unique in the target web.
   1 When the action is =save=, =checkpoint=, =quietsave=, or =preview=:
      1 The new text is taken from the =text= parameter, if it is defined,
         * otherwise it is taken from the =templatetopic=, if it is defined, (new topic _only_)
         * otherwise it is taken from the previous version of the topic, if any,
      1 The name of the new form is taken from the =formtemplate=, if defined
         * otherwise it is taken from the =templatetopic=, if defined, (new topic _only_)
         * otherwise it is taken from the previous version of the topic, if any,
         * otherwise no form is attached.
      1 The value for each field in the form is taken from the query, if it is defined
         * otherwise it is taken from the =templatetopic=, if defined, (new topic _only_)
         * otherwise it is taken from the previous version of the topic, if any,
         * otherwise it defaults to the empty string.

Merging is only enabled if the topic text comes from =text= and =originalrev= is &gt; 0 and is not the same as the revision number of the most recent revision. If merging is enabled both the topic and the meta-data are merged.

Form field values are passed in parameters named 'field' - for example, if I have a field =Status= the parameter name is =Status=.

---+++ =search=
CGI gateway to the =%<nop>SEARCH%= functionality driven by the following CGI parameters:

| *Parameter:* | *Description:* | *Default:* |
| ="text"= | Search term. Is a keyword search, literal search or regular expression search, depending on the =type= parameter. SearchHelp has more | required |
| =search="text"= | (Alternative to above) | N/A |
| =web="Name"= <br /> =web="%USERSWEB%, Know"= <br /> =web="all"= | Comma-separated list of webs to search. See [[%SYSTEMWEB%.Macros#VarSEARCH][Macros#VarSEARCH]] for more details. | Current web |

| =multiple="on"= | Multiple hits per topic. Each hit can be [[FormattedSearch][formatted]]. The last token is used in case of a regular expression ";" _and_ search | Only one hit per topic |
| =nofinalnewline="on"= | If =on=, the result of the macro does not end in a line by itself. Any text continuing immediately after the search macro on the same line will be rendered as part of the table generated by the search, if appropriate. | =off= |

---+++ =statistics=
Refresh the WebStatistics topics in range of webs.
| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |

   3 from browser %SCRIPTURL{"statistics"}%/%WEB% updates %WEB%
   4 from command line twiki/bin/statistics updates _all user webs_
   5 from command line twiki/bin/statistics -webs=Userweb,Sandbox updates _Userweb,Sandbox_
   6 from command line twiki/bin/statistics %WEB%.<nop>WebHome updates %WEB%

see SiteTools#WebStatistics_site_statistics for updating statistics using cron.

---+++ =upload=
Uploads an attachment to a topic. The HTTP request is expected to be in =multipart/form-data= format.
| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| =hidefile= | if defined, will not show file in attachment table | |
| =filepath= | local (client) path name of the file being uploaded. This is used to look up the data for the file in the HTTP query. | |
| =filename= | deprecated, do not use | |
| =filecomment= | Comment to associate with file in attachment table | |
| =createlink= | if defined, will create a link to file at end of topic | |
| =changeproperties= | if defined, this is a property change operation *only* - no file will be uploaded. | null |

You can use a tool like =curl= to upload files from the command line using this script.

---+++ =view=
Used for viewing topics.

| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| =raw=on= | Shows the text of the topic in a scrollable textarea | |
| =raw=debug= | As =raw=on=, but also shows the metadata (forms etc) associated with the topic. | |
| =raw=text= | Shows only the source of the topic, as plain text (Content-type: text/plain). Only shows the body text, *not* the form or other meta-data. |
| =raw=all= | Shows only the source of the topic, as plain text (Content-type: text/plain), *with embedded meta-data*. This may be useful if you want to extract the source of a topic to a local file on disc. | |
| =section= | Allows to view only a part of the topic delimited by a named section (see %SYSTEMWEB%.VarSTARTSECTION). If the given section is not present, no topic content is displayed. | |
| =contenttype= | Allows you to specify a different *Content-Type:* (e.g. =contenttype=text/plain=) | |
| =rev= | Revision to view (e.g. =rev=45=) | |
| =template= | Allows you to specify a different skin template, overriding the 'view' template the view script would normally use. The default template is =view=. For example, you could specify [[%SCRIPTURLPATH{"view"}%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%?template=edit][%SCRIPTURLPATH{"view"}%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%?template=edit]]. This is mainly useful when you have specialised templates for a Wiki Application. | |
| =topic= | redirects (at the beging of the cgi script running) to show the spcified Web.Topic, or, redirects to a URL, if allowed by {AllowRedirectUrl} and {PermittedRedirectHostUrls} | |

%X% For historical reasons, the view script has a special interpretation of the =text= skin. In TWiki < 4.0 the =skin=text= parameter was used like this:
=http<nop>://.../view/MyWeb/MyTopic?skin=text&contenttype=text/plain&raw=on=
which shows the topic as plain text; useful for those who want to download plain text for the topic.
Using =skin=text= this way is *DEPRECATED*, use =raw=text= instead.

---+++ =viewfile=
Used for viewing attachments. Normally, a site will publish the attachments (=pub=) directory using a URL. However if it contains sensitive information, you will want to protect attachments using [[AccessControl][AccessControls]]. In this case, you can use the =viewfile= script to give access to attachments while still checking access controls.

| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| =filename= | name of attachment | |
| =rev= | Revision to view | |

Instead of using the =filename= parameter, you can append the attachment name
to the end of the URL path (after the topic) e.g. =%SCRIPTURL{viewfile}%/Webname/TopicName/Attachment.gif=

---++ Command Line Scripts
Details on command line scripts located in the =twiki/tools= directory.

---+++ =geturl.pl=
This is a very simple script to get the content of a web site. It is marked as _deprecated_ and might be removed (or enhanced) in a future release. Its functions are covered by the standard =wget= and =curl= commands.
   * Usage:    =geturl.pl &lt;host&gt; &lt;path&gt; [&lt;port&gt; [&lt;header&gt;]]=
   * Example:  =geturl.pl some.domain /some/dir/file.html 80=
   * Will get: =http://some.domain:80/some/dir/file.html=

---+++ =rewriteshebang.pl=
Simple script to rewrite the =#!/usr/bin/perl= shebang lines specific to your local Perl installation. It will rewrite the first line of all your cgi scripts so they use a different shebang line. Use it if your perl is in a non-standard location, or you want to use a different interpreter (such as 'speedy').

---+++ =tick_twiki.pl=
This script executes a number of non-essential regular administration tasks that will help keep your site healthy and happy, such as removing expired sessions and lease files.

It is intended to be run as a cron job or a scheduled task once a week. Example crontab entry:%BR%
=0 0 * * 0 cd /usr/twiki/bin && perl ../tools/tick_twiki.pl=

__Note:__ The script has to be run by a user who can write files created by the webserver user.
