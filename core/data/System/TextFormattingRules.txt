---+ Text Formatting

Working in Foswiki is as easy as typing in text. You don't need to know HTML, though you can use it if you prefer. Links to topics are created automatically when you enter WikiWords. And Foswiki shorthand gives you all the power of HTML with a simple coding system that takes no time to learn. It's all laid out below.

---++ Hyperlinks

Being able to create links without any special formatting is a core Foswiki feature, made possible with WikiWords and inline URLs.

---+++ Internal Links

   * GoodStyle is a WikiWord that links to the <nop>GoodStyle topic located in the current web.

   * NotExistingYet is a topic waiting to be written. Create the topic by clicking on the *?*. (Try clicking, but then, *Cancel* - creating the topic would wreck this example!)

---+++ External Links

   * Protocols matching the configuration parameter =LinkProtocolPattern=, which by default is set to =(file|ftp|gopher|https|http|irc|mailto|news|nntp|telnet)=, are linked automatically. You might change this setting to add more protocols (such as smb). Thus, all lines containing:
      * =file://...=
      * =ftp://...=
      * =gopher://...=
      * =https://...=
      * =http://...=
      * =irc://...=
      * =mailto:...@...=
      * =news://...=
      * =nntp://...=
      * =telnet://...=
   are linked automatically.

   * E-mail addresses like =name@domain.com= are linked automatically.

   * =[<nop>[Square bracket rules]]= let you easily create [[#SquareBrackets][non-WikiWord links]].
      * You can also write =[<nop>[http://yahoo.com Yahoo home page]]= as an easier way of doing external links with descriptive text for the link, such as [[http://yahoo.com/ Yahoo home page]].

---++ Common Editing Errors

Foswiki formatting rules are fairly simple to use and quick to type. However, there are some things to watch out for, taken from the TextFormattingFAQ:

   * *Q:* Text enclosed in angle brackets like =&lt;filename&gt;= is not displayed. How can I show it as it is?
      * *A:* The ='&lt;'= and ='&gt;'= characters have a special meaning in HTML, they define HTML tags. You need to escape them, so write ='&amp;lt;'= instead of ='&lt;'=, and ='&amp;gt;'= instead of ='&gt;'=. <br /> Example: Type ='prog &amp;lt;filename&amp;gt;'= to get ='prog &lt;filename&gt;'=.

   * *Q:* Why is the ='&'= character sometimes not displayed?
      * *A:* The ='&'= character has a special meaning in HTML, it starts a so called character entity, i.e. ='&amp;copy;'= is the =&copy;= copyright character. You need to escape ='&amp;'= to see it as it is, so write ='&amp;amp;'= instead of ='&amp;'=. <br /> Example: Type ='This &amp;amp; that'= to get ='This &amp; that'=.
