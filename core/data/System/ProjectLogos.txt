---++ Logo Customization

The logo can be changed by redefining the =WIKILOGOIMG= [[%SYSTEMWEB%.PreferenceSettings][preference setting]].

If you use the official artwork on your own site you must link back to Foswiki.org. Use this HTML (with any logo file on this page):

=&lt;a href="http://foswiki.org/"&gt;&lt;img src="%<nop>PUBURL%/%<nop>SYSTEMWEB%/ProjectLogos/smallPowered.gif" alt="This site is powered by Foswiki" title="This site is powered by Foswiki" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;=

If you create your own skin you are encouraged to add this small logo at the bottom of your skin.

---++ Right to use Artwork
