---+!! TWiki Release 4.2.2 (Freetown), %$DATE%

%TOC%

---++ Introduction

TWiki 4.2.0 was released 22 Jan 2008 and introduced some hot new features that make TWiki a better user experience for both beginners and experienced application developers. It also contained quite a number of bugfixes since 4.1.2.

TWiki 4.2.1 is a patch release which only contains bug fixes. More than 150 bugs have been fixed since the release of 4.2.0 in all areas of TWiki.

TWiki 4.2.2 is a patch release which only contains bug fixes. More than __TODO__ bugs have been fixed since the release of 4.2.1 in all areas of TWiki.


It is highly recommended to upgrade TWiki 4.2.x to 4.2.2. Users will find the 4.2.2 much more stable in daily use.

---++ Pre-installed Extensions

TWiki 4.2.2 is shipped with

   * *Plugins:* !CommentPlugin, !EditTablePlugin, !EmptyPlugin, !InterwikiPlugin, !PreferencesPlugin, !RenderListPlugin, !SlideShowPlugin, !SmiliesPlugin, !SpreadSheetPlugin, !TablePlugin, !TinyMCEPlugin, !TwistyPlugin, !WysiwygPlugin
   * *Contribs:* !BehaviourContrib, !JSCalendarContrib, !MailerContrib, !TipsContrib, !TWikiUserMappingContrib, !TwistyContrib
   * *Skins:* !ClassicSkin, !PatternSkin

---++ New Features Highlights

   * *Easier Installation and Upgrade*
      * New Internal Admin Login feature. See below.
      * The !Main.TWikiUsers topic is no longer distributed as a default topic in Main. See below. 
      * A new directory =working= which per default is located in the twiki root which contains registration_approvals, tmp, and work_areas. See below
      * !ResetPassword, !ChangePassword, !ChangeEmailAddress, and !TWikiRegistration no longer contains yellow text that you have to remove.
      * Configure can now authenticate when connecting to local plugins repository.

   * *Usability Enhancements*
      * New WYSIWYG editor based on !TinyMCE replaces the Kupu based editor. See below.
      * New "Restore topic" feature has been added to the _More Topic Actions_ menu. You can now much more easily restore an older version of a topic including the values a topic form.
      * Attachment comments no longer has a limit to the length of the text.
      * The viewfile script now accepts similar simple URL path as used to access a topic. E.g. =http:<nop>//example.com/twiki/bin/viewfile/TWiki/DocumentGraphics/addon.gif= means the same as =http<nop>://example.com/twiki/bin/viewfile/TWiki/DocumentGraphics?filename=addon.gif=. This make it simpler to use command line tools like =wget= in Linux to download attachments.

   * *Application Platform Enhancements*
      * Enhancements to IF: allows, ingroup, istopic, and isweb

   * *Search Enhancements*
      * New =query= search mode supports SQL-style queries over form fields
        and other meta-data.

   * *Skins and Templates Enhancements*
      * The !PatternSkin which is the default skin for TWiki has got a face lift.
      * The template have been heavily refactored. This will break some tailorings and home made skins but it was needed to make it easier to make skins in the future.

   * *Miscellaneous Feature Enhancements*
      * Many new functions in the API for plugin developers.
      * Table of Content (TOC) feature enhanced 
      * User Mapping (mapping between login name and !WikiName) code has been extended to allow pluggable modules to integrate with all sorts of alternative authentication and Management schemes. For normal cases you use the default !TWikiUserMapping which is using the !Main.TWikiUsers topic to map between login and !WikiName. A new !BaseUserMapping is provided for TWikis where you only have guests and an administrator. In this case you use the login and password given in configure to login as an admin.

---++ Important Changes since 4.2.1
This is a fast trip bug fix for issues found during upgrades from 4.2.0 to 4.2.1.
---+++ Highlights of bug fixes since 4.2.1

__TODO__

See the full list of bug fixes at the bottom of this topic.

---++ Important Changes since 4.2.0

---+++ Perl 5.8 is now minimum requirement with Wysiwyg

In TWiki 4.2.1 the support of international characters has been improved. Especially when using the Wysiwyg editor. This requires that perl internally works with unicode and that the Encode CPAN lib is installed. For this reason Perl 5.8.X is required for Wysiwyg support. TWiki will run with perl 5.6.1 if !WysiwygPlugin is disabled.

---+++ TWiki now installs and works with Perl 5.10.0.

Newer distributions of Linux now ships with Perl 5.10.0. TWiki has been tested with Perl 5.10.0 and it should work fine. If the CGI library is version 3.37 you will need to update it to a newer version as the 3.37 contains some fatal bugs. Simply updating your perl using the standard update feature in your distribution may be enough to cure this problem.

---+++ The RCS files in subdirectories feature removed

The feature related to the config option TWiki::cfg{RCS}{useSubDir} has been removed. It never really worked and there are all sorts of issues related to it with respect to distribution of extensions and packaged applications, and it does not really add any performance advantages. So instead of trying to repair a bad feature that never really worked it was decided to remove it.

The removal was announced in a news letter and in a proposal topic, and discussed at several release meetings, and noone objected against its removal.

If you have run TWiki with this feature (maybe with a self implemented fix of the code) you will need to simply copy all the ,v files in all RCS directories to the directory above (where you find the .txt file or the attached filed) when you upgrade to 4.2.1.

---+++ The Japanese language file has been renamed

We decided to rename the locale/jp.po to locale/ja.po to match the rule that the file has the same name as the code for the locale.

For those using the Japanese language file you need to do the following if you upgrade TWiki

   * Delete the old jp.po file
   * Delete the locale/languages.cache file (it gets recreated by TWiki first time it runs with language files)
   * Rename the entry =$TWiki::cfg{Languages}{jp}{Enabled} = 1;= in the lib/LocalSite.cfg to =$TWiki::cfg{Languages}{ja}{Enabled} = 1;=

---+++ Highlights of bug fixes since 4.2.0

   * Much more stable Wysiwyg editor
      * Better support for non-English characters
      * Better handling of bullet points
      * Pickaxe feature which enables quick swap between Wysiwyg and raw edit is more stable
      * Attachment of files within Wysiwyg editor working better
      * Linking feature fixed
   * More stable !EditTablePlugin
   * Better support for UTF8 though UTF8 is still regarded as experimental and features such as wiki words do not work with non-english characters. UTF8 will be a good choice for languages such as Chinese, Japanese and Korean
   * Better support for non English charsets
   * Easier configuration of language settings in configure
   * Renaming of webs much improved
   * Compatibility with perl 5.10
   * Fixes related to mandatory fields in forms
   * Universal edit button with Firefox extension
   * Access controls using login ID instead of wikiname which was broken in 4.2.0 works again
   * Search features have had a few bugs fixed
   * Several bugs related to attaching files have been fixed
   * Some cross site scripting possibilities have been eliminated
   * Plugins that uses beforeAttachmentSaveHandler now works stable (e.g. !BlackListPlugin)
   * The feature of having RCS files (the ,v file) in a separate directory never worked. Feature has now been removed as it really does not give any advantages.
   * User mapping feature improved to ensure 1:1 mapping between canonical user ID and login ID which is important for security

See the full list of bug fixes at the bottom of this topic.

---++ Important Changes since 4.1.2

---+++ New WYSIWYG Editor

TWiki now ships with a new WYSIWYG editor based on !TinyMCE replaces the Kupu based editor.%BR% !TinyMCE is not a perfect Wysiwyg editor but it is magnitudes better than the Kupu editor

The !WysiwygPlugin that drives the engine behind both !TinyMCE has additionally been heavily improved so that less TWiki Applications are negatively affected by editing WYSIWYG

When !TinyMCEPlugin is enabled the Edit button per default becomes WYSIWYG editing mode. A new Raw Edit link has been added to enable application developers to edit the good old way

The WYSIWYG button is removed when using !TinyMCE instead of Kupu.

---+++ NEWTOPICLINKSYMBOL removed

The NEWTOPICLINKSYMBOL preference which was deprecated in 4.1 has now been removed from the code. If you want to control the appearance of new links, you can use the more flexible NEWLINKFORMAT.

---+++ !UserForm and !NewUserTemplate Customization

When a new user registers on TWiki his user topic is created based on the =NewUserTemplate= and =UserForm=.

The =NewUserTemplate= was located in the TWiki web and the =UserForm= in the Main web. When upgrading TWiki these were some of the topics you had to take care not to overwrite.

From 4.2.0 the =UserForm= and =NewUserTemplate= are distributed in the TWiki web. If you create the two in the Main web the Main web version will be used instead. So if you tailor the user topic format or the form then you should always copy the two files to the Main web and modify the ones in the Main web. When you later upgrade TWiki your tailored template and form will not be overwritten.

---+++ !TWikiUsers no longer distributed

The =Main.TWikiUsers= topic contains all the registered users. It is a topic you do not want to overwrite when you upgrade TWiki.

From 4.2.0 this file is no longer included in the TWiki distribution. When you register the first time TWiki creates the =Main.TWikiUsers= topic in the Main web if it does not exist already. This means that you can now upgrade TWiki without risk of overwriting the important =TWikiUsers= topic.

   * For new installers this makes no difference at all
   * For upgraders this is one less problem to worry about as your important !Main.TWikiUsers topic now no longer gets overwritten when upgrading.
   
---+++ New =working= directory

A new directory =working= which per default is located in the twiki root, has been introduced which contains:

   * registration_approvals - with 4.2.0 it is moved to here from the data directory)
   * tmp - so we now avoid having to fight with special access rights and /tmp directory that gets cleaned out when booting.
   * work_areas - with 4.2.0 it is moved to here from the pub directory. Configure automatically moved the directory when you upgrade.

Note: Remember to restrict access to this new directory when you upgrade.
   
---+++ New Internal Admin Login

TWiki 4.2 introduces a new _Internal Admin Login_ feature which uses "admin" (configurable) as username and the password from configure to become temporary administrator. 
When you do a new installation you need to use this feature as !Main.TWikiAdminGroup is now access restricted by default to avoid security attacks during the hours an installation may take. 
From configure there is a link to the !TWikiAdminGroup topic and on !TWikiAdminGroup the step by step instructions are written in a yellow box. 

---+++ Rearchitected User Mapping system (a transperant change for end users)

The User Mapping system has been further rearchitected to reduce its dependance on the traditional TWiki User topic based management and mapping implementation. TWiki is now capable of 
dealing with login names that are not 7bit ascii (by transforming those logins into a 'cUID' that can be used by rcs). TWiki::Users now uses =TWikiIterators= opening the way for much larger
user sets.

---++ API Enhancements (Func)

   * $TWiki::Plugins::VERSION is now 1.2
   * Added =decodeFormatTokens($str) -> $unencodedString=
   * Added =eachChangeSince($web, $time) -> $iterator=

   * Added =sanitizeAttachmentName($fname) -> ($fileName, $origName)=
   * Added =spaceOutWikiWord( $word, $sep ) -> $text=
   * Added =wikiNameToEmails( $wikiname ) -> @emails=
   * Deprecated getOopsUrl( $web, $topic, $template, $param1, $param2, $param3, $param4 ) -> $url
   * Deprecated permissionsSet( $web ) -> $boolean

---++ Deprecation Notices

The %<nop>MAINWEB% and %<nop>SYSTEMWEB% variables have been deprecated. For compatibility reasons they are unlikely to ever be removed completely, but you should use the %<nop>USERSWEB% and %<nop>SYSTEMWEB% variables instead.

In Func getOopsUrl and permissionsSet have been declared deprecated. There is no plan to remove them yet.
