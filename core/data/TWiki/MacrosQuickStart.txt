---++ Macros Quickstart

%STARTINCLUDE%

Macros are names enclosed in percent signs that are that are expanded to some other text when the topic
is displayed. For example, =%<nop>TOPIC%= is expanded to %TOPIC%.
Some macros can take arguments in curly braces - for example, =%<nop>INCLUDE{"OtherTopic" ARG="arg"}%=.

Many macro definitions are built-in, and others (preference settings) are predefined for your convenience. You can also define your own
preference settings at the entire site, individual web, or individual topic level. For more information,
go to *[[Macros]]*

Macros are fully expanded _before_ any of the TWiki text formatting rules are applied.

*Documentation Graphics:* There are many graphics available to use in your topics. Use =%<nop>ICON{"help"}%=, =%<nop>ICON{"tip"}%=, and =%<nop>ICON{"warning"}%= to get: %H%, %T%, and %X%, respectively. DocumentGraphics lists them all.

%ICON{"tip"}% To "escape" a variable, prefix it with an exclamation mark. Write: =!%<nop>SOMEVARIABLE%= to get: !%SOMEVARIABLE%.
