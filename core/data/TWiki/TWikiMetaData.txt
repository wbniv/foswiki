---+ TWiki Meta Data

_Additional topic data, program-generated or from TWikiForms, is stored embedded in the topic text using =META:= tags_

%TOC%

---++ Overview

By default, TWiki stores topics in files on disk, in a really simple and obvious directory structure. The big advantage of this approach is that it makes it really easy to manipulate topics from outside TWiki, and is also very safe; there are no complex binary indexes to maintain, and moving a topic from one TWiki to another is as simple as copying a couple of text files.

To keep eveything together in one place, TWiki uses a simple method for embedding additional data (program-generated or from TWikiForms) in topics. It does this using =META:= tags.

=META:= data includes program-generated info like FileAttachment and topic movement data, and user-defined TWikiForms info.

---++ Meta Data Syntax

   * Format is the same as in TWikiVariables, except all fields have a key.
      * =%<nop>META:&lt;type&gt;{key1="value1" key2="value2" ...}%=

   * Order of fields within the meta variables is not defined, except that if there is a field with key =name=, this appears first for easier searching (note the order of the variables themselves is defined).

   * Each meta variable is on one line.

   * Values in meta-data are URL encoded so that characters such as \n can be stored.

<blockquote>

---++ Meta Data Specifications

The current version of Meta Data is 1.0, with support for the following variables.

---+++ META:TOPICINFO

|  *Key*  |  *Comment*          |
| version | Same as RCS version |
| date    | integer, unix time, seconds since start 1970 |
| author  | last to change topic, is the REMOTE_USER |
| format  | Format of this topic, will be used for automatic format conversion |

---+++ META:TOPICMOVED

This is optional, exists if topic has ever been moved.  If a topic is moved more than once, only the most recent META:TOPICMOVED meta variable exists in the topic, older ones are to be found in the rcs history.

=%<nop>META:TOPICMOVED{from="Codev.OldName" to="Codev.NewName" by="talintj" date="976762680"}%=

|  *Key*  |  *Comment*          |
| from | Full name, i.e., web.topic |
| to   | Full name, i.e., web.topic |
| by   | Who did it, is the REMOTE_USER, not <nop>WikiName |
| date | integer, unix time, seconds since start 1970 |

Notes: 
   * at present version number is not supported directly, it can be inferred from the RCS history.
   * there is only one META:TOPICMOVED in a topic, older move information can be found in the RCS history.
 
---+++ META:TOPICPARENT

| *Key*   | *Comment* |
| name    | The topic from which this was created, typically when clicking on a =?= questionmark link, or by filling out a form.  Normally just =TopicName=, but it can be a full =Web.TopicName= format if the parent is in a different Web. |

---+++ META:FILEATTACHMENT

| *Key*   | *Comment* |
| name    | Name of file, no path.  Must be unique within topic |
| version | Same as RCS revision  |
| path    | Full path file was loaded from |
| size    | In bytes |
| date    | integer, unix time, seconds since start 1970 |
| user    | the REMOTE_USER, not <nop>WikiName |
| comment | As supplied when file uploaded |
| attr    | =h= if hidden, optional |

Extra fields that are added if an attachment is moved:

| *Key*   | *Comment* |
| movedfrom | full topic name - web.topic |
| movedby   | the REMOTE_USER, not <nop>WikiName |
| movedto   | full topic name - web.topic |
| moveddate | integer, unix time, seconds since start 1970 |

---+++ META:FORM

| *Key*   | *Comment* |
| name    | A topic name - the topic represents one of the TWikiForms.  Can optionally include the web name (i.e., web.topic), but doesn't normally |

---+++ META:FIELD

Should only be present if there is a META:FORM entry.  Note that this data is used when viewing a topic, the form template definition is not read.

| *Key*   | *Name*   |
| name    | Ties to entry in TWikiForms template, is title with all bar alphanumerics and . removed |
| title   | Full text from TWikiForms template |
| value   | Value user has supplied via form |

---+++ Recommended Sequence

There is no absolute need for Meta Data variables to be listed in a specific order within a topic, but it makes sense to do so a couple of good reasons:

   * form fields remain in the order they are defined
   * the =diff= function output appears in a logical order

The recommended sequence is:

   * =META:TOPICINFO=
   * =META:TOPICPARENT= (optional)
   * text of topic
   * =META:TOPICMOVED= (optional)
   * =META:FILEATTACHMENT= (0 or more entries)
   * =META:FORM= (optional)
   * =META:FIELD= (0 or more entries; FORM required)

---++ Viewing Meta Data in Page Source

When viewing a topic the ==Raw Text== link can be clicked to show the text of a topic (i.e., as seen when editing).  This is done by adding <code>raw=on</code> to URL.  <code>raw=debug</code> shows the meta data as well as the topic data, ex: <a href="%SCRIPTURLPATH{"view"}%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%?raw=debug">debug view for this topic</a>

#MetaDataRendering
---++ Rendering Meta Data

Meta Data is rendered with the %<nop>META% variable. This is mostly used in the =view=, =preview= and =edit= scripts.

You can render form fields in topic text by using the FORMFIELD variable. Example:%BR%
=%<nop>FORMFIELD{"TopicClassification"}%= %BR%
For details, see VarFORMFIELD.

Current support covers:

| *Variable usage:*   | *Comment:*  |
| =%<nop>META{"form"}%= | Show form data, see TWikiForms. |
| =%<nop>META{"formfield"}%= | Show form field value. Parameter: ==name="field_name"==. Example:%BR% =%<nop>META{ "formfield" name="TopicClassification" }%= |
| =%<nop>META{"attachments"}%= | Show attachments, except for hidden ones. Options: <br /> \
    ==all="on"==: Show all attachments, including hidden ones. |
| =%<nop>META{"moved"}%= | Details of any topic moves. |
| =%<nop>META{"parent"}%= | Show topic parent. Options: <br /> \
    ==dontrecurse="on"==: By default recurses up tree, at some cost. <br /> \
    ==nowebhome="on"==: Suppress <nop>%HOMETOPIC%. <br /> \
    ==prefix="..."==: Prefix for parents, only if there are parents, default =""=. <br /> \
    ==suffix="..."==: Suffix, only appears if there are parents, default =""=. <br /> \
    ==separator="..."==: Separator between parents, default is =" &gt; "=. |

__Note:__ SEARCH can also be used to render meta data, see examples in FormattedSearch and SearchPatternCookbook.
