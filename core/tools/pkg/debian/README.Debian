TWiki for Debian
----------------

Initial wiki contents
=====================

/usr/share/twiki/twiki-data.tar.gz has the initial data set, if
you find you want to restore the data in /var/lib/twiki/data/ after
experimenting.
/usr/share/twiki/twiki-pub.tar.gz has the initial pub data set.
It should also be unpacked to /var/lib/twiki/pub

Post-install TWiki configuration
================================

The Debian TWiki package provides a default generic configuration, but
additional configuration steps are required from the administrator,
considering the versatile nature of TWiki. Most of them are described
in TWiki's standard documentation available in the 'TWiki' wiki/web
installed by default (see
http://localhost/cgi-bin/twiki/view/TWiki/InstallationGuide#Next_Steps
for a start).

Access to the 'configure' script is protected with an authentified
HTTP session. This means that TWiki configuration through the Web
interface, is only possible by launching a web browser from the
server's local accounts.  It is still possible to configure it by
editing the /etc/twiki/LocalSite.cfg file it that's more convenient.
  
The username and password for this 'configure' CGI access are defined 
during package install (so-called "apache user" debconf questions, 
with a username by default 'admin').


ATTENTION :

Note that you should create yourself (inside TWiki, with it's user
registration mechanism) a TWiki user account, and add it
Main.TWikiAdminGroup to restrict Admin privileges to that user.

The procedure for doing so is described in the TWiki documentation.

The Debian package only protects access to the 'configure' script, and
in no way deals with TWiki's users and groups, so the default ACLs
right after install more or less allow anyone to modify contents of
the Wiki, including locking other users out.


Installing multiple TWiki instances on the same server
======================================================

For multiple TWiki's on the same machine, it is recommended that you
just have multiple data sets on one TWiki.  If you really need more
than one, in particular to isolate the data under a different uid,
there are a bunch of things you need to do; I can make suggestions, or
if you figure it out let me know and I'll try and integrate such
enhancements into the package.

Security Alert: Login bypass allows view of access restricted content
(CVE-2006-6071)
http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/SecurityAlert-CVE-2006-6071

Attack Vectors

An unauthorized user can login by cancelling out of a failed login.

Impact

An unauthorized user is able to view content in access restricted topics.
Editing topics and attaching files is not impacted.

Severity Level

The TWiki SecurityTeam triaged this issue as documented in
TWikiSecurityAlertProcess and assigned the following severity level:

    * Severity 3 issue: TWiki content or browser is compromised 

MITRE Name for this Vulnerability

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name
CVE-2006-6071 to this vulnerability.

Details

Your site may be vulnerable if:

   1. If you have ErrorDocument 401 set to point to the TWikiRegistration topic
      (or any other TWiki topic) and 
   2. You are using ApacheLogin with TWiki-4.0 and have sessions enabled, or
      you are using an earlier TWiki version with SessionPlugin, and 
   3. You are running Apache 1.3 

The exploit can be used to view pages protected by TWiki permissions. It does
not allow you to to gain write access. You can verify if your site is
vulnerable as follows:

   1. Click the 'Login' link in the left bar
   2. Enter the login name of a valid user, but an incorrect password.
   3. Click "Ok"
   4. If apache re-prompts, enter the same username and password again
   5. Click "Cancel" 

If your site is vulnerable you will be redirected to the TWikiRegistration
topic with the valid user apparently logged in (the name appears in the left
bar).

Countermeasures

    * Restrict access to the TWiki installation.
    * Apply the hotfix indicated below. 

    * NOTE: The hotfix is known to prevent the current attacks, but it might not be a complete fix 

Hotfix

Delete the ErrorDocument line in the Apache configuration (httpd.conf or
.htaccess), or (preferred) change it to point to a static HTML page. This page
can safely contain a link to the TWikiRegistration page. For example,

<html>
<title>Failed login</title>
<head>
</head>
<body>
Your login attempt failed.
<p />
Do you want to
<a href="/cgi-bin/view/TWiki/TWikiRegistration">register in TWiki</a>?
</body>
</html>

(modify the href as appropriate for your site.)
