# Sample '.htaccess' file for 'pub' subdirectory

# Controls access to Foswiki 'pub' subdirectory - copy this into 'pub', 
# naming it '.htaccess', to have Apache use it.

# This is useful if you install Foswiki on a web host, or an intranet host
# where you can't edit the Apache http.conf file.  If you can edit the
# http.conf file, just set the 'Allow from all' there (or locate these
# directories outside the Web-visible directory tree.)

# Allow all access
Allow from all

# Deny people from looking at the index
# Bare in mind that this is largely inadequate
# See http://foswiki.org/System/AccessControl#Controlling_access_to_Attachment
# and http://foswiki.org/Tasks/Item610
# If you think you have a solution it is in your best interests to share it 
# so others can test your idea.

# We need to protect the entire pub directory tree against any kind of script execution
# Foswiki has a renaming protection scheme that alters certain file names to prevent
# script execution but it may not be 100% safe only to rely on this. The safest
# protection is to disabled all scripting.

# If you have PHP4 or PHP5 installed as Apache module make sure the directive below is enabled
# If you do not have PHP installed you will need to comment out the directory below
# to avoid errors.
# If PHP is installed as CGI this flag is not needed and will in fact make Apache fail 
php_flag engine off

# If you have PHP3 installed as Apache module make sure the directive below is enabled
# If PHP is installed as CGI this flag is not needed and will in fact make Apache fail
#php3_engine off

# This line will redefine the mime type for the most common types of scripts
AddType text/plain .shtml .php .php3 .phtml .phtm .pl .py .cgi

#add an Expires header that is sufficiently in the future that the browser does not even ask if its uptodate
# reducing the load on the server significantly
#IF you can, you should enable this - it _will_ improve your foswiki experience, even if you set it to under one day.
