# Example httpd.conf file for Foswiki.
#
# You are recommended to take a copy of this file and edit
# the paths to match your installation. Then add:
# include "/home/httpd/foswiki/foswiki_httpd.conf"
# to the end of your main httpd.conf file.
#
# See also http://foswiki.org/Support/ApacheConfigGenerator
# that helps you configure Apache

# The first parameter will be part of the URL to your installation e.g.
# http://example.com/foswiki/bin/view/...
# The second parameter must point to the physical path on your disk. Be
# careful not to lose any trailing /'s.

#### Change the _second_ path to match your local installation
ScriptAlias /foswiki/bin/ "/home/httpd/foswiki/bin/"

# This defines a url that points to the root of the foswiki installation. It is
# used to access files in the pub directory (attachments etc)
# It must come _after_ the ScriptAlias.

#### Change the path to match your local installation
Alias /foswiki/ "/home/httpd/foswiki/"

# Block access to typical spam related attachments (.htm and .html files)
# Except the Foswiki directory which is read only and does have attached html files.
# You should uncomment the two lines below if the Foswiki is on the public Internet
#SetEnvIf Request_URI "foswiki/pub/.*\.[hH][tT][mM]?$" blockAccess
#SetEnvIf Request_URI "foswiki/pub/Foswiki/.*\.[hH][tT][mM]?$" !blockAccess

# We set an environment variable called blockAccess.
#
# Setting a BrowserMatchNoCase to ^$ is important. It prevents Foswiki from
# including its own topics as URLs and also prevents other Foswikis from
# doing the same. This is important to prevent the most obvious
# Denial of Service attacks.
#
# You can expand this by adding more BrowserMatchNoCase statements to
# block evil browser agents trying the impossible task of mirroring a Foswiki.
# http://foswiki.org/Support/ApacheConfigGenerator has a good list
# of bad spiders to block.
#
# Example:
# BrowserMatchNoCase ^SiteSucker blockAccess
BrowserMatchNoCase ^$ blockAccess

# This specifies the options on the Foswiki scripts directory. The ExecCGI
# and SetHandler tell apache that it contains scripts. "Allow from all"
# lets any IP address access this URL.

# This sets the options on the pub directory, which contains attachments and

# Finally all execution of PHP and other scripts is disabled.

# Note that files in pub are *not* protected by Foswiki Access Controls,
# so if you want to control access to files attached to topics, you may
# need to add your own .htaccess files to subdirectories of pub. See the
# Apache documentation on .htaccess for more info.
