---+ package Foswiki::Plurals

Handle conversion of plural topic names to singular form.

=begin TML

---++ StaticMethod singularForm($web, $pluralForm) -> $singularForm

Try to singularise plural topic name.
   * =$web= - the web the topic must be in
   * =$pluralForm= - topic name
Returns undef if no singular form exists, otherwise returns the
singular form of the topic

I18N - Only apply plural processing if site language is English, or
if a built-in English-language web.  Plurals
apply to names ending in 's', where topic doesn't exist with plural
name.

Note that this is highly langauge specific, and need to be enabled
on a per-installation basis with $Foswiki::cfg{PluralToSingular}.
