=begin TML

---+ package Foswiki::AggregateIterator

combine multiple iterators

package Foswiki::AggregateIterator;

=begin TML

---++ new(\@list, $unique)

Create a new iterator over the given list of iterators. The list is not damaged in
any way.

if $unique is set, we try to not repeat values.
Warning: $unique assumes that the values are strings (so works for cUID's )

=cut

sub new {
    my ( $class, $list, $unique ) = @_;
    my $this = bless(
        {
            Itr_list    => $list,
            Itr_index   => 0,
            index       => 0,
            process     => undef,
            filter      => undef,
            next        => undef,
            unique      => $unique,

=begin TML

---++ hasNext() -> $boolean

Returns false when the iterator is exhausted.

<verbatim>
my $it = new Foswiki::ListIterator(\@list);

        $this->{unique_hash}{$value} = 1;
        return 1;
    }

    return 0;
}

=begin TML

---++ next() -> $data

Return the next entry in the list.

The iterator object can be customised to pre- and post-process entries from
the list before returning them. This is done by setting two fields in the
iterator object:

   * ={filter}= can be defined to be a sub that filters each entry. The entry
     will be ignored (next() will not return it) if the filter returns false.
   * ={process}= can be defined to be a sub to process each entry before it
     is returned by next. The value returned from next is the value returned
     by the process function.


=cut

sub next {
    my $this = shift;
    $this->hasNext();
    my $n = $this->{next};
    $this->{next} = undef;
    $n = &{ $this->{process} }($n) if $this->{process};

    #print STDERR "next - $n \n";
    return $n;
}
