---+ package Foswiki::AccessControlException

Exception used raise an access control violation. This exception has the
following fields:
   * =web= - the web which was being accessed
   * =topic= - the topic being accessed (if any)
   * =user= - canonical username of the person doing the accessing. Use
   the methods of the Foswiki::Users class to get more information about the
   user.
   * =mode= - the access mode e.g. CHANGE, VIEW etc
   * =reason= a text string giving the reason for the refusal.

The exception may be thrown by plugins. If a plugin throws the exception, it
will normally be caught and the browser redirected to a login screen (if the
user is not logged in) or reported (if they are and just don't have access).

API version $Date$ (revision $Rev$)

*Since* _date_ indicates where functions or parameters have been added since
the baseline of the API (TWiki release 4.2.3). The _date_ indicates the
earliest date of a Foswiki release that will support that function or
parameter.

*Deprecated* _date_ indicates where a function or parameters has been
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deprecation][deprecated]]. Deprecated
functions will still work, though they should
_not_ be called in new plugins and should be replaced in older plugins
as soon as possible. Deprecated parameters are simply ignored in Foswiki
releases after _date_.

*Until* _date_ indicates where a function or parameter has been removed.
The _date_ indicates the latest date at which Foswiki releases still supported
the function or parameter.
