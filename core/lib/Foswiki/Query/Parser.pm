# Operators
#
# In the following, the standard InfixParser node structure is extended by
# one field, 'exec'.
#
# exec is the name of a member function of the 'Query' class that evaluates
# the node. It is called on the node and is passed a $domain. The $domain
# is a reference to a hash that contains the data being operated on, and a
# reference to the meta-data of the topic being worked on (this is
# effectively the "topic object"). The data being operated on can be a
# Meta object, a reference to an array (such as attachments), a reference
# to a hash (such as TOPICINFO) or a scalar. Arrays can contain other arrays
# and hashes.
