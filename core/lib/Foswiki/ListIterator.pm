=begin TML

---+ package Foswiki::ListIterator

Iterator over a list

=cut

package Foswiki::ListIterator;

use strict;

=begin TML

---++ new(\@list)

Create a new iterator over the given list. Designed primarily for operations
over fully defined lists of object references. The list is not damaged in
any way.

=cut

sub new {
    my ( $class, $list ) = @_;
    my $this = bless(
        {
            list    => $list,
            index   => 0,
            process => undef,
            filter  => undef,
            next    => undef,
        },
        $class
    );
    return $this;
}

=begin TML

---++ hasNext() -> $boolean

Returns false when the iterator is exhausted.

<verbatim>
my $it = new Foswiki::ListIterator(\@list);
while ($it->hasNext()) {
   ...
</verbatim>

=cut

sub hasNext {
    my ($this) = @_;
    return 1 if $this->{next};
    my $n;
    do {
        if ( $this->{list} && $this->{index} < scalar( @{ $this->{list} } ) ) {
            $n = $this->{list}->[ $this->{index}++ ];
        }
        else {
            return 0;
        }
    } while ( $this->{filter} && !&{ $this->{filter} }($n) );
    $this->{next} = $n;
    return 1;
}

=begin TML

---++ next() -> $data

Return the next entry in the list.

The iterator object can be customised to pre- and post-process entries from
the list before returning them. This is done by setting two fields in the
iterator object:

   * ={filter}= can be defined to be a sub that filters each entry. The entry
     will be ignored (next() will not return it) if the filter returns false.
   * ={process}= can be defined to be a sub to process each entry before it
     is returned by next. The value returned from next is the value returned
     by the process function.

For example,
<verbatim>
my @list = ( 1, 2, 3 );

my $it = new Foswiki::ListIterator(\@list);
$it->{filter} = sub { return $_[0] != 2 };
$it->{process} = sub { return $_[0] + 1 };
while ($it->hasNext()) {
    my $x = $it->next();
    print "$x, ";
}
</verbatim>
will print
<verbatim>
2, 4
</verbatim>

=cut

sub next {
    my $this = shift;
    $this->hasNext();
    my $n = $this->{next};
    $this->{next} = undef;
    $n = &{ $this->{process} }($n) if $this->{process};
    return $n;
}
