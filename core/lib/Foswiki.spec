# ======================================================================
# This page is used to set up the configuration options for Foswiki. Certain of
# the settings are required; these are marked with a
# <font color="red">*</font>. Fill in the settings, and then select 'Update'.
# The settings will be updated and you will be returned to this page. Any
# errors in your configuration will be <font color="red">highlighted</font>
# below.
# <p />
# If you are installing Foswiki for the first time, and you are on a
# Unix or Linux platform and behind a firewall, the only section you
# should need to worry about below is "General path settings".
# <p />
# If you are on a public site, you will need to consider carefully
# how you are going to manage authentication and access control.
# <p />
# There are a number of documentation topics describing how to
# configure Foswiki for different platforms, and a lot of support
# available at Foswiki.org. The configuration settings currently in
# use can be managed using the 'configure' script.
#
# If your Foswiki site is working, the front page should be
# <a href="$Foswiki::cfg{ScriptUrlPath}/view$Foswiki::cfg{ScriptSuffix}">right here</a>

# NOTE FOR DEVELOPERS: you can use $Foswiki::cfg variables in other settings,
# but you must be sure they are only evaluated under program control and
# not when this file is loaded. For example:
## $Foswiki::cfg{Blah} = "$Foswiki::cfg{DataDir}/blah.dat"; # BAD
## $Foswiki::cfg{Blah} = '$Foswiki::cfg{DataDir}/blah.dat'; # GOOD

my $OS = $Foswiki::cfg{OS} || '';
# Note that the general path settings are deliberately commented out.
# This is because they *must* be defined in LocalSite.cfg, and *not* here.

#---+ General path settings
# If you are a first-time installer; once you have set up the next
# six paths below, your Foswiki should work - try it. You can always come
# back and tweak other settings later.<p />
# <b>Security Note:</b> Only the URL paths listed below should
# be browseable from the web. If you expose any other directories (such as
# lib or templates) you are opening up routes for possible hacking attempts.

# **URL M**
#  This is the root of all Foswiki URLs e.g. http://myhost.com:123.
# $Foswiki::cfg{DefaultUrlHost} = 'http://your.domain.com';

# **STRING**
# If your host has aliases (such as both www.twiki.org and twiki.org, and some IP addresses)
# you need to list them to tell Foswiki that redirecting to them is OK. Foswiki uses redirection
# as part of its normal mode of operation when it changes between editing and viewing.
# The security setting {AllowRedirectUrl} is per default disabled making redirecting to other
# domains restricted to prevent Foswiki from being used in phishing attacks to protect it from
# middleman exploits. You can add additional URLs to this setting to enable redirects to
# additional trusted sites. Enter as comma separated list of URLs or hostnames. The URL must 
# be in the format http://your.domain.com.
$Foswiki::cfg{PermittedRedirectHostUrls} = '';

# **PATH M**
# This is the 'cgi-bin' part of URLs used to access the Foswiki bin
# directory e.g. <code>/twiki/bin</code><br />
# Do <b>not</b> include a trailing /.
# <p />
# See http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Support.ShorterUrlCookbook for more information on setting up
# Foswiki to use shorter script URLs.
# $Foswiki::cfg{ScriptUrlPath} = '/twiki/bin';

# **URLPATH M**
# Attachments URL path e.g. /twiki/pub
# <p /><b>Security Note:</b> files in this directory are *not*
# protected by Foswiki access controls. If you require access controls, you
# will have to use webserver controls (e.g. .htaccess on Apache)
# $Foswiki::cfg{PubUrlPath} = '/twiki/pub';

# **PATH M**
# Attachments store (file path, not URL), must match /twiki/pub e.g.
# /usr/local/twiki/pub
# $Foswiki::cfg{PubDir} = '/home/httpd/twiki/pub';

# **PATH M**
# Template directory e.g. /usr/local/twiki/templates
# $Foswiki::cfg{TemplateDir} = '/home/httpd/twiki/templates';

# **PATH M**
# Topic files store (file path, not URL) e.g. /usr/local/twiki/data
# $Foswiki::cfg{DataDir} = '/home/httpd/twiki/data';

# **PATH M**
# Translation files directory (file path, not URL) e.g. /usr/local/twiki/locales
# $Foswiki::cfg{LocalesDir} = '/home/httpd/twiki/po';

# **PATH M**
# Directory where Foswiki stores files that are required for the management
# of Foswiki, but are not normally required to be browsed from the web.
# A number of subdirectories will be created automatically under this
# directory:
# <ul><li>{WorkingDir}<tt>/tmp/</tt> - used for security-related temporary
# files (these files can be deleted at any time without permanent damage)
# <ul><li>
# <i>Passthrough files</i> are used by Foswiki to work around the limitations
# of HTTP when redirecting URLs</li>
# <li><i>Session files</i> are used to record information about active
# users - for example, whether they are logged in or not.</li>
# </ul>
# For obvious reasons, these files must <b>not</b> be browseable from the web!
# Additionally you are recommended to restrict access rights to this directory
# so only the web server user can create files.</li>
# <li>{WorkingDir}<tt>/work_areas</tt> - these are work areas used by
# extensions that need to store data on the disc </li>
# <li>{WorkingDir}<tt>/registration_approvals</tt> - this is used by the
# default Foswiki registration process to store registrations that are pending
# verification.</li>
# </ul>
# $Foswiki::cfg{WorkingDir} = '/home/httpd/twiki/working';

# **STRING 10**
# Suffix of Foswiki CGI scripts (e.g. .cgi or .pl). You may need to set this
# if your webserver requires an extension.
$Foswiki::cfg{ScriptSuffix} = '';

# ---+ Security setup

# **STRING H**

$Foswiki::cfg{Password} = '';

#---++ Paths
# **PATH M**
# Path control. Overrides the default PATH setting to control
# where Foswiki looks for external programs, such as grep and rcs.
# By restricting this path to just a few key
# directories, you increase the security of your Foswiki.
# <ol>
# <li>Unix or Linux
#  <ul>
#   <li>Path separator is :</li>
#   <li>Make sure diff and shell (Bourne or bash type) are found on path.</li>
#   <li>Typical setting is <tt>/bin:/usr/bin</tt></li>
#  </ul>
# <li>Windows ActiveState Perl, using DOS shell</li>
#  <ul>
#   <li>path separator is ;</li>
#   <li>The Windows system directory is required.</li>
#   <li>Use '\' not '/' in pathnames.</li>
#   <li>Typical setting is <tt>C:\windows\system32</tt></li>

#  </ul>
# </ol>
$Foswiki::cfg{SafeEnvPath} = '';

#---++ Sessions

# **BOOLEAN**
# You can use persistent CGI session tracking even if you are not using login.
# This allows you to have persistent session variables - for example, skins.
# Client sessions are not required for logins to work, but Foswiki will not
# be able to remember logged-in users consistently.
#
# See System.UserAuthentication for a full discussion of the pros and
# cons of using persistent sessions. Session files are stored in the
# <tt>{WorkingDir}/tmp</tt> directory.
$Foswiki::cfg{UseClientSessions} = 1;

# **STRING 20 EXPERT**
# Set the session timeout, in seconds. The session will be cleared after this
# amount of time without the session being accessed. The default is 6 hours
# (21600 seconds).<p />
# <b>Note</b>By default, session expiry is done "on the fly" by the same
# processes used to
# serve Foswiki requests. As such it imposes a load on the server. When
# there are very large numbers of session files, this load can become
# significant. For best performance, you can set {Sessions}{ExpireAfter}
# to a negative number, which will mean that Foswiki won't try to clean
# up expired sessions using CGI processes. Instead you should use a cron
# job to clean up expired sessions. The standard maintenance cron script
# <tt>tools/tick_twiki.pl</tt> includes this function.
$Foswiki::cfg{Sessions}{ExpireAfter} = 21600;

# **NUMBER EXPERT**
# TemplateLogin only.
# Normally the cookie that remembers a user session is set to expire
# when the browser exits, but using this value you can make the cookie
# expire after a set number of seconds instead. If you set it then
# users will be able to tick a 'Remember me' box when logging in, and
# their session cookie will be remembered even if the browser exits.<p />
# This should always be the same as, or longer than, {Sessions}{ExpireAfter},
# otherwise Foswiki may delete the session from its memory even though the
# cookie is still active.<p />
# A value of 0 will cause the cookie to expire when the browser exits.
# One month is roughly equal to 2600000 seconds.
$Foswiki::cfg{Sessions}{ExpireCookiesAfter} = 0;

# **BOOLEAN EXPERT**
# If you have persistent sessions enabled, then Foswiki will use a cookie in
# the browser to store the session ID. If the client has cookies disabled,
# then Foswiki will not be able to record the session. As a fallback, Foswiki
# can rewrite local URLs to pass the session ID as a parameter to the URL.
# This is a potential security risk, because it increases the chance of a
# session ID being stolen (accidentally or intentionally) by another user.
# If this is turned off, users with cookies disabled will have to
# re-authenticate for every secure page access (unless you are using
# {Sessions}{MapIP2SID}).
$Foswiki::cfg{Sessions}{IDsInURLs} = 0;

# **BOOLEAN EXPERT**
# It's important to check that the user trying to use a session is the
# same user who originally created the session. Foswiki does this by making
# sure, before initializing a previously stored session, that the IP
# address stored in the session matches the IP address of the user asking
# for that session. Turn this off if a client IP address may change during
# the lifetime of a session (unlikely)
$Foswiki::cfg{Sessions}{UseIPMatching} = 1;

# **BOOLEAN EXPERT**
# For compatibility with older versions, Foswiki supports the mapping of the
# clients IP address to a session ID. You can only use this if all
# client IP addresses are known to be unique.
# If this option is enabled, Foswiki will <b>not</b> store cookies in the
# browser.
# The mapping is held in the file $Foswiki::cfg{WorkingDir}/tmp/ip2sid.
# If you turn this option on, you can safely turn {Sessions}{IDsInURLs}
# <i>off</i>.
$Foswiki::cfg{Sessions}{MapIP2SID} = 0;

#---++ Authentication
# **SELECTCLASS none,Foswiki::LoginManager::*Login**
# Foswiki supports different ways of responding when the user asks to log
# in (or is asked to log in as the result of an access control fault).
# They are:
# <ol><li>
# none - Don't support logging in, all users have access to everything.
# </li><li>
# Foswiki::LoginManager::TemplateLogin - Redirect to the login template, which
#   asks for a username and password in a form. Does not cache the ID in
#   the browser, so requires client sessions to work.
# </li><li>
# Foswiki::LoginManager::ApacheLogin - Redirect to an '...auth' script for which
#   Apache can be configured to ask for authorization information. Does
#   not require client sessions, but works best with them enabled.
# </li></ol>
$Foswiki::cfg{LoginManager} = 'Foswiki::LoginManager::TemplateLogin';

# **BOOLEAN EXPERT**
# Browsers typically remember your login and passwords to make authentication 
# more convenient for users. If your Foswiki is used on public terminals, or other

# **STRING 100 EXPERT**
# Comma-separated list of scripts that require the user to authenticate.
# With TemplateLogin, any time an unauthenticated user attempts to access
# one of these scripts, they will be redirected to the login script. With
# ApacheLogin, they will be redirected to the logon script (note
# login and logon; they are different scripts). This approach means that
# only the logon script needs to be specified as require valid-user when
# using Apache authentication.
# <p/>
# If you want finer access control (e.g. authorised users only in one web
# but open access in another) then you should *clear* this list, and use
# Foswiki Permissions to control access. Users wishing to make changes will
# have to log in by clicking a "log in" link instead of being automatically
# redirected when they try to edit.
$Foswiki::cfg{AuthScripts} = 'attach,edit,manage,rename,save,upload,viewauth,rdiffauth,rest';

#---++ Registration
# **BOOLEAN**
# If you want users to be able to use a login ID other than their
# wikiname, you need to turn this on. It controls whether the 'LoginName'

$Foswiki::cfg{Register}{AllowLoginName} = $FALSE;

# **BOOLEAN EXPERT**
# If a login name (or an internal user id) cannot be mapped to a wikiname,

# to obscure this stored id by setting this option to true.
$Foswiki::cfg{RenderLoggedInButUnknownUsers} = $FALSE;

#---++ Passwords
# **SELECTCLASS none,Foswiki::Users::*User**
# Name of the password handler implementation. The password handler manages
# the passwords database, and provides password lookup, and optionally
# password change, services. Foswiki ships with two alternative implementations:
# <ol><li>
# Foswiki::Users::HtPasswdUser - handles 'htpasswd' format files, with
#   passwords encoded as per the HtpasswdEncoding
# </li><li>
# Foswiki::Users::ApacheHtpasswdUser - should behave identically to
# HtpasswdUser, but uses the CPAN:Apache::Htpasswd package to interact
# with Apache. It is shipped mainly as a demonstration of how to write
# a new password manager.
# </li></ol>
# You can provide your own alternative by implementing a new subclass of
# Foswiki::Users::Password, and pointing {PasswordManager} at it in
# lib/LocalSite.cfg.<p />
# If 'none' is selected, users will not be able to change passwords
# and TemplateLogin manager then will always succeed, regardless of
# what username or password they enter. This may be useful when you want to
# enable logins so Foswiki can identify contributors, but you don't care about
# passwords. Using ApacheLogin and PassordManager set to 'none' (and

# matter are {UserInterfaceInternationalisation}, which enables user interface
# internationalisation, and {Site}{CharSet}, which controls which charset Foswiki
# will use for storing topics and displaying content for the users. As soon as
# {UserInterfaceInternationalisation} is set and the required
# (<code>Locale::Maketext::Lexicon</code> and <code>Encode</code>/MapUTF8 Perl
# modules) are installed (see the <em>CGI Setup</em> section above), the

# for no languages doesn't make any sense.

# But for best performance you should enable only the languages you really
# need. English is the default language, and is always enabled.

# *FINDEXTENSIONS*
# **STRING 80 EXPERT**
# <b>Extensions Repositories Search List</b><br />
# Foswiki extension repositories are just Foswiki webs that are organised in the
# same way as the Plugins web on Foswiki.org. The 'Find more extensions' link
# above searches these repositories for installable extensions. To set up an
# extensions repository:
# <ol>
# <li>Create a Foswiki web to contain the repository</li>
# <li>Copy the <tt>FastReport</tt> page from <a href="http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Plugins/FastReport?raw=on">Foswiki:Extensions.FastReport</a> to your new web</li>
# <li> Copy the <tt>PackageForm</tt> page from <a href="http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Plugins/PackageForm?raw=on">Foswiki:Extensions.PackageForm</a> to your new web</li>
# <li> Set the <tt>WEBFORMS</tt> variable in WebPreferences to <tt>PackageForm</tt></li>
# </ol>
# The page for each extension must have the Foswiki form <tt>PackageForm</tt>,
# and should have the packaged extension attached as a <tt>zip</tt> and/or
# <tt>tgz</tt> file.
# <p />
# This setting is a semicolon-separated list of repository specifications, each in the format: <i>name=(listurl,puburl)</i>,
# where:
# <ul>
# <li><i>name</i> is the symbolic name of the repository e.g. Foswiki.org</li>
# <li><i>listurl</i> is the root of a view URL
# <li><i>puburl</i> is the root of a download URL
# </ul>
# For example,<code>
# foswiki.org=(http://foswiki.org/Extensions/,http://foswiki.org/pub/Plugins/);
# twiki.org=(http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Plugins/,http://twiki.org/p/pub/Plugins/);</code><p />
