---+ package TWiki::AccessControlException

Exception used raise an access control violation. This exception has the
following fields:
   * =web= - the web which was being accessed
   * =topic= - the topic being accessed (if any)
   * =user= - canonical username of the person doing the accessing. Use
   the methods of the TWiki::Users class to get more information about the
   user.
   * =mode= - the access mode e.g. CHANGE, VIEW etc
   * =reason= a text string giving the reason for the refusal.

The exception may be thrown by plugins. If a plugin throws the exception, it
will normally be caught and the browser redirected to a login screen (if the
user is not logged in) or reported (if they are and just don't have access).

---+ ClassMethod new($mode, $user, $web, $topic, $reason)

   * =$mode= - mode of access (view, change etc)
   * =$user= - canonical user name of user doing the accessing
   * =$web= - web being accessed
   * =$topic= - topic being accessed
   * =$reason= - string reason for failure

All the above fields are accessible from the object in a catch clause
in the usual way e.g. =$e->{web}= and =$e->{reason}=

---++ ObjectMethod stringify() -> $string

Generate a summary string. This is mainly for debugging.
