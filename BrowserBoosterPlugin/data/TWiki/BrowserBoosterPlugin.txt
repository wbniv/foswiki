---++ Usage

After the plugin is enabled in configure, you do not need to do anything further.

---++ Why do I want to use this extension?

There are at least to situations where this plugin helps you to boost the speed of your TWiki page loads.

   1 Your client uses a Firefox2 browser
   1 Your network has a high latency

The Firefox2 browser handles web pages with many CSS and Javascript files very bad. Firefox renders a web page significantly faster, if all CSS and JS data is embedded within the webpage rather than spread over many external files/urls. This is a known bug and will be fixed in version 3.

On a network with a high latency every additional css or js file costs you an additional http request (with all the overhead of (potentially) new connections. You can save that time by embedding the content into the main page.


---++ Installation Instructions
