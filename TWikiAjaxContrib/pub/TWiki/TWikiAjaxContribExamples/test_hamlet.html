<b>BERNARDO</b>

	Who's there?

<blockquote>
	Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.

<b>BERNARDO</b>
<blockquote>
	Long live the king!

<blockquote>
	Bernardo?

<b>BERNARDO</b>
<blockquote>
	He.

<blockquote>
	You come most carefully upon your hour.

<b>BERNARDO</b>
<blockquote>
	'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.

<b>FRANCISCO</b>
<blockquote>
	For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
	<br />
	And I am sick at heart.

<b>BERNARDO</b>
<blockquote>
	Have you had quiet guard?

<b>FRANCISCO</b>
<blockquote>
	Not a mouse stirring.

<b>BERNARDO</b>
<blockquote>
	Well, good night.
	<br />
	If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,

<blockquote>
	Say,
	<br />
	What, is Horatio there?
</blockquote>
<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	A piece of him.
</blockquote>
<b>BERNARDO</b>
<blockquote>
	Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
</blockquote>
<b>MARCELLUS</b>
<blockquote>
	What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
</blockquote>
<b>BERNARDO</b>
<blockquote>
	I have seen nothing.
</blockquote>
<b>MARCELLUS</b>
<blockquote>
	Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
	<br />
	And will not let belief take hold of him
	<br />
	Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
	<br />
	Therefore I have entreated him along
	<br />
	With us to watch the minutes of this night;
	<br />
	That if again this apparition come,
	<br />
	He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
</blockquote>
<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
</blockquote>
<b>BERNARDO</b>
<blockquote>
	Sit down awhile;
	<br />
	And let us once again assail your ears,
	<br />
	That are so fortified against our story
	<br />
	What we have two nights seen.
</blockquote>
<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	Well, sit we down,
	<br />
	And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
</blockquote>
<b>BERNARDO</b>
<blockquote>
	Last night of all,
	<br />
	When yond same star that's westward from the pole
	<br />
	Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
	<br />
	Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
	<br />
	The bell then beating one,--
	<br />
	<p class="c2">
		Enter Ghost
	</p>
</blockquote>
<b>MARCELLUS</b>
<blockquote>
	Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
</blockquote>
<b>BERNARDO</b>
<blockquote>
	In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
</blockquote>
<b>MARCELLUS</b>
<blockquote>
	Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
</blockquote>
<b>BERNARDO</b>
<blockquote>
	Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.
</blockquote>
<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
</blockquote>
<b>BERNARDO</b>
<blockquote>
	It would be spoke to.
</blockquote>
<b>MARCELLUS</b>
<blockquote>
	Question it, Horatio.
</blockquote>
<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
	<br />
	Together with that fair and warlike form
	<br />
	In which the majesty of buried Denmark
	<br />
	Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
</blockquote>
<b>MARCELLUS</b>
<blockquote>
	It is offended.
</blockquote>
<b>BERNARDO</b>
<blockquote>
	See, it stalks away!
</blockquote>
<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
	<br />
	<p class="c2">
		Exit Ghost
	</p>
</blockquote>
<b>MARCELLUS</b>
<blockquote>
	'Tis gone, and will not answer.
</blockquote>
<b>BERNARDO</b>
<blockquote>
	How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
	<br />
	Is not this something more than fantasy?
	<br />
	What think you on't?
</blockquote>
<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	Before my God, I might not this believe
	<br />
	Without the sensible and true avouch
	<br />
	Of mine own eyes.
</blockquote>
<b>MARCELLUS</b>
<blockquote>
	Is it not like the king?
</blockquote>
<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	As thou art to thyself:
	<br />
	Such was the very armour he had on
	<br />
	When he the ambitious Norway combated;
	<br />
	So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
	<br />
	He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
	<br />
	'Tis strange.
</blockquote>
<b>MARCELLUS</b>
<blockquote>
	Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
	<br />
	With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
</blockquote>
<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	In what particular thought to work I know not;
	<br />
	But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
	<br />
	This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
</blockquote>
<b>MARCELLUS</b>
<blockquote>
	Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
	<br />
	Why this same strict and most observant watch
	<br />
	So nightly toils the subject of the land,
	<br />
	And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
	<br />
	And foreign mart for implements of war;
	<br />
	Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
	<br />
	Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
	<br />
	What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
	<br />
	Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
	<br />
	Who is't that can inform me?
</blockquote>
<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	That can I;
	<br />
	At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
	<br />
	Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
	<br />
	Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
	<br />
	Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
	<br />
	Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
	<br />
	For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
	<br />
	Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
	<br />
	Well ratified by law and heraldry,
	<br />
	Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
	<br />
	Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
	<br />
	Against the which, a moiety competent
	<br />
	Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
	<br />
	To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
	<br />
	Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
	<br />
	And carriage of the article design'd,
	<br />
	His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
	<br />
	Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
	<br />
	Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
	<br />
	Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
	<br />
	For food and diet, to some enterprise
	<br />
	That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
	<br />
	As it doth well appear unto our state--
	<br />
	But to recover of us, by strong hand
	<br />
	And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
	<br />
	So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
	<br />
	Is the main motive of our preparations,
	<br />
	The source of this our watch and the chief head
	<br />
	Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
</blockquote>
<b>BERNARDO</b>
<blockquote>
	I think it be no other but e'en so:
	<br />
	Well may it sort that this portentous figure
	<br />
	Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
	<br />
	That was and is the question of these wars.
</blockquote>
<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
	<br />
	In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
	<br />
	A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
	<br />
	The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
	<br />
	Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
	<br />
	As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
	<br />
	Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
	<br />
	Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
	<br />
	Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
	<br />
	And even the like precurse of fierce events,
	<br />
	As harbingers preceding still the fates
	<br />
	And prologue to the omen coming on,
	<br />
	Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
	<br />
	Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
	<br />
	But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
	<br />
	<p class="c2">
		Re-enter Ghost
	</p>
	I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
	<br />
	If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
	<br />
	Speak to me:
	<br />
	If there be any good thing to be done,
	<br />
	That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
	<br />
	Speak to me:
	<br />
	<p class="c2">
		Cock crows
	</p>
	If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
	<br />
	Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
	<br />
	Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
	<br />
	Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
	<br />
	For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
	<br />
	Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.
</blockquote>
<b>MARCELLUS</b>
<blockquote>
	Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
</blockquote>
<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	Do, if it will not stand.
</blockquote>
<b>BERNARDO</b>
<blockquote>
	'Tis here!
</blockquote>
<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	'Tis here!
</blockquote>
<b>MARCELLUS</b>
<blockquote>
	'Tis gone!
	<br />
	<p class="c2">
		Exit Ghost
	</p>
	We do it wrong, being so majestical,
	<br />
	To offer it the show of violence;
	<br />
	For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
	<br />
	And our vain blows malicious mockery.
</blockquote>
<b>BERNARDO</b>
<blockquote>
	It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
</blockquote>
<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	And then it started like a guilty thing
	<br />
	Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
	<br />
	The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
	<br />
	Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
	<br />
	Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
	<br />
	Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
	<br />
	The extravagant and erring spirit hies
	<br />
	To his confine: and of the truth herein
	<br />
	This present object made probation.
</blockquote>
<b>MARCELLUS</b>
<blockquote>
	It faded on the crowing of the cock.
	<br />
	Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
	<br />
	Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
	<br />
	The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
	<br />
	And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
	<br />
	The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
	<br />
	No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
	<br />
	So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
</blockquote>
<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	So have I heard and do in part believe it.
	<br />
	But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
	<br />
	Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
	<br />
	Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
	<br />
	Let us impart what we have seen to-night
	<br />
	Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
	<br />
	This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
	<br />
	Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
	<br />
	As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
</blockquote>
<b>MARCELLUS</b>
<blockquote>
	Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
	<br />
	Where we shall find him most conveniently.
	<br />
	<p class="c2">
		Exeunt

	Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET, POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords, and Attendants 
</blockquote>
<b>KING CLAUDIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
	<br />
	The memory be green, and that it us befitted
	<br />
	To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
	<br />
	To be contracted in one brow of woe,
	<br />
	Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
	<br />
	That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
	<br />
	Together with remembrance of ourselves.
	<br />
	Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
	<br />
	The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
	<br />
	Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
	<br />
	With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
	<br />
	With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
	<br />
	In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
	<br />
	Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
	<br />
	Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
	<br />
	With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
	<br />
	Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
	<br />
	Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
	<br />
	Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
	<br />
	Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
	<br />
	Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
	<br />
	He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
	<br />
	Importing the surrender of those lands
	<br />
	Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
	<br />
	To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
	<br />
	Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
	<br />
	Thus much the business is: we have here writ
	<br />
	To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
	<br />
	Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
	<br />
	Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
	<br />
	His further gait herein; in that the levies,
	<br />
	The lists and full proportions, are all made
	<br />
	Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
	<br />
	You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
	<br />
	For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
	<br />
	Giving to you no further personal power
	<br />
	To business with the king, more than the scope
	<br />
	Of these delated articles allow.
	<br />
	Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
</blockquote>
<b>CORNELIUS</b><b>VOLTIMAND</b>
<blockquote>
	In that and all things will we show our duty.

<b>KING CLAUDIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.

	<p class="c2">
		Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS
	</p>
	And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
	<br />
	You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
	<br />
	You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
	<br />
	And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
	<br />
	That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
	<br />
	The head is not more native to the heart,
	<br />
	The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
	<br />
	Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
	<br />
	What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
</blockquote>
<b>LAERTES</b>
<blockquote>
	My dread lord,
	<br />
	Your leave and favour to return to France;
	<br />
	From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
	<br />
	To show my duty in your coronation,
	<br />
	Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
	<br />
	My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
	<br />
	And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
</blockquote>
<b>KING CLAUDIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
</blockquote>
<b>LORD POLONIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
	<br />
	By laboursome petition, and at last
	<br />
	Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
	<br />
	I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
</blockquote>
<b>KING CLAUDIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
	<br />
	And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
	<br />
	But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--

<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	[Aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind.
</blockquote>
<b>KING CLAUDIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
</blockquote>
<b>QUEEN GERTRUDE</b>
<blockquote>
	Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
	<br />
	And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
	<br />
	Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
	<br />
	Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
	<br />
	Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
	<br />
	Passing through nature to eternity.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	Ay, madam, it is common.
</blockquote>
<b>QUEEN GERTRUDE</b>
<blockquote>
	If it be,
	<br />
	Why seems it so particular with thee?
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
	<br />
	'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
	<br />
	Nor customary suits of solemn black,
	<br />
	Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
	<br />
	No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
	<br />
	Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
	<br />
	Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
	<br />
	That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
	<br />
	For they are actions that a man might play:
	<br />
	But I have that within which passeth show;
	<br />
	These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
</blockquote>
<b>KING CLAUDIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
	<br />
	To give these mourning duties to your father:
	<br />
	But, you must know, your father lost a father;
	<br />
	That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
	<br />
	In filial obligation for some term
	<br />
	To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
	<br />
	In obstinate condolement is a course
	<br />
	Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
	<br />
	It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
	<br />
	A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
	<br />
	An understanding simple and unschool'd:
	<br />
	For what we know must be and is as common
	<br />
	As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
	<br />
	Why should we in our peevish opposition
	<br />
	Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
	<br />
	A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
	<br />
	To reason most absurd: whose common theme
	<br />
	Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
	<br />
	From the first corse till he that died to-day,
	<br />
	'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
	<br />
	This unprevailing woe, and think of us
	<br />
	As of a father: for let the world take note,
	<br />
	You are the most immediate to our throne;
	<br />
	And with no less nobility of love
	<br />
	Than that which dearest father bears his son,
	<br />
	Do I impart toward you. For your intent
	<br />
	In going back to school in Wittenberg,
	<br />
	It is most retrograde to our desire:
	<br />
	And we beseech you, bend you to remain
	<br />
	Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
	<br />
	Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
</blockquote>
<b>QUEEN GERTRUDE</b>
<blockquote>
	Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
	<br />
	I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
</blockquote>
<b>KING CLAUDIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
	<br />
	Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
	<br />
	This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
	<br />
	Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
	<br />
	No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
	<br />
	But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
	<br />
	And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,

	Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.

	O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
	<br />
	Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
	<br />
	Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
	<br />
	His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
	<br />
	How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
	<br />
	Seem to me all the uses of this world!
	<br />
	Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
	<br />
	That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
	<br />
	Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
	<br />
	But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
	<br />
	So excellent a king; that was, to this,
	<br />
	Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
	<br />
	That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
	<br />
	Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
	<br />
	Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
	<br />
	As if increase of appetite had grown
	<br />
	By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
	<br />
	Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
	<br />
	A little month, or ere those shoes were old
	<br />
	With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
	<br />
	Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
	<br />
	O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
	<br />
	Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
	<br />
	My father's brother, but no more like my father
	<br />
	Than I to Hercules: within a month:
	<br />
	Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
	<br />
	Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
	<br />
	She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
	<br />
	With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
	<br />
	It is not nor it cannot come to good:

	But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.

<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
	<br />
	And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?
</blockquote>
<b>MARCELLUS</b>
<blockquote>
	My good lord--
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
	<br />
	But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
</blockquote>
<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	A truant disposition, good my lord.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	I would not hear your enemy say so,
	<br />
	Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
	<br />
	To make it truster of your own report
	<br />
	Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
	<br />
	But what is your affair in Elsinore?
	<br />
	We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
</blockquote>
<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
	<br />
	I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
</blockquote>
<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats
	<br />
	Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
	<br />
	Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
	<br />
	Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
	<br />
	My father!--methinks I see my father.
</blockquote>
<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	Where, my lord?
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	In my mind's eye, Horatio.
</blockquote>
<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	He was a man, take him for all in all,
	<br />
	I shall not look upon his like again.
</blockquote>
<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	Saw? who?
</blockquote>
<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	My lord, the king your father.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	The king my father!
</blockquote>
<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	Season your admiration for awhile
	<br />
	With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
	<br />
	Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
	<br />
	This marvel to you.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	For God's love, let me hear.
</blockquote>
<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	Two nights together had these gentlemen,
	<br />
	Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
	<br />
	In the dead vast and middle of the night,
	<br />
	Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
	<br />
	Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
	<br />
	Appears before them, and with solemn march
	<br />
	Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
	<br />
	By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
	<br />
	Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled
	<br />
	Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
	<br />
	Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
	<br />
	In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
	<br />
	And I with them the third night kept the watch;
	<br />
	Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
	<br />
	Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
	<br />
	The apparition comes: I knew your father;
	<br />
	These hands are not more like.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	But where was this?
</blockquote>
<b>MARCELLUS</b>
<blockquote>
	My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	Did you not speak to it?
</blockquote>
<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	My lord, I did;
	<br />
	But answer made it none: yet once methought
	<br />
	It lifted up its head and did address
	<br />
	Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
	<br />
	But even then the morning cock crew loud,
	<br />
	And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
	<br />
	And vanish'd from our sight.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	'Tis very strange.
</blockquote>
<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
	<br />
	And we did think it writ down in our duty
	<br />
	To let you know of it.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
	<br />
	Hold you the watch to-night?
</blockquote>
<b>MARCELLUS</b><b>BERNARDO</b>
<blockquote>
	We do, my lord.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	Arm'd, say you?
</blockquote>
<b>MARCELLUS</b><b>BERNARDO</b>
<blockquote>
	Arm'd, my lord.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	From top to toe?
</blockquote>
<b>MARCELLUS</b><b>BERNARDO</b>
<blockquote>
	My lord, from head to foot.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	Then saw you not his face?
</blockquote>
<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	What, look'd he frowningly?
</blockquote>
<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	Pale or red?
</blockquote>
<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	Nay, very pale.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	And fix'd his eyes upon you?
</blockquote>
<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	Most constantly.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	I would I had been there.
</blockquote>
<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	It would have much amazed you.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
</blockquote>
<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
</blockquote>
<b>MARCELLUS</b><b>BERNARDO</b>
<blockquote>
	Longer, longer.
</blockquote>
<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	Not when I saw't.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	His beard was grizzled--no?
</blockquote>
<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	It was, as I have seen it in his life,
	<br />
	A sable silver'd.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	I will watch to-night;
	<br />
	Perchance 'twill walk again.
</blockquote>
<b>HORATIO</b>
<blockquote>
	I warrant it will.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	If it assume my noble father's person,
	<br />
	I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
	<br />
	And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
	<br />
	If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
	<br />
	Let it be tenable in your silence still;
	<br />
	And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
	<br />
	Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
	<br />
	I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
	<br />
	Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,

	My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
	<br />
	And, sister, as the winds give benefit
	<br />
	And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,

</blockquote>
<b>OPHELIA</b>
<blockquote>
	Do you doubt that?
</blockquote>
<b>LAERTES</b>
<blockquote>
	For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
	<br />
	Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
	<br />
	A violet in the youth of primy nature,
	<br />
	Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
	<br />
	The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
</blockquote>
<b>OPHELIA</b>
<blockquote>
	No more but so?
</blockquote>
<b>LAERTES</b>
<blockquote>
	Think it no more;
	<br />
	For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
	<br />
	In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
	<br />
	The inward service of the mind and soul
	<br />
	Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
	<br />
	And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
	<br />
	The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
	<br />
	His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
	<br />
	For he himself is subject to his birth:
	<br />
	He may not, as unvalued persons do,
	<br />
	Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
	<br />
	The safety and health of this whole state;
	<br />
	And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
	<br />
	Unto the voice and yielding of that body
	<br />
	Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
	<br />
	It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
	<br />
	As he in his particular act and place
	<br />
	May give his saying deed; which is no further
	<br />
	Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
	<br />
	Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
	<br />
	If with too credent ear you list his songs,
	<br />
	Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
	<br />
	To his unmaster'd importunity.
	<br />
	Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
	<br />
	And keep you in the rear of your affection,
	<br />
	Out of the shot and danger of desire.
	<br />
	The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
	<br />
	If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
	<br />
	Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
	<br />
	The canker galls the infants of the spring,
	<br />
	Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
	<br />
	And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
	<br />
	Contagious blastments are most imminent.
	<br />
	Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
	<br />
	Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
</blockquote>

	<br />
	Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
	<br />
	Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
	<br />
	Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,

	And recks not his own rede.

	The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
	<br />
	And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
	<br />
	And these few precepts in thy memory
	<br />
	See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
	<br />
	Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
	<br />
	Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
	<br />
	Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
	<br />
	Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
	<br />
	But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
	<br />
	Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
	<br />
	Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
	<br />
	Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
	<br />
	Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
	<br />
	Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
	<br />
	Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
	<br />
	But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
	<br />
	For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
	<br />
	And they in France of the best rank and station
	<br />
	Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
	<br />
	Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
	<br />
	For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
	<br />
	And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
	<br />
	This above all: to thine ownself be true,
	<br />
	And it must follow, as the night the day,
	<br />
	Thou canst not then be false to any man.

	As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
	<br />
	What is between you? give me up the truth.
</blockquote>
<b>OPHELIA</b>
<blockquote>
	He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
	<br />
	Of his affection to me.
</blockquote>
<b>LORD POLONIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
	<br />
	Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
	<br />
	Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
	I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
</blockquote>
<b>LORD POLONIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
	<br />
	That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
	<br />
	Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
	<br />
	Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
	<br />
	Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.
</blockquote>
<b>OPHELIA</b>
<blockquote>
	My lord, he hath importuned me with love
	<br />
	In honourable fashion.
</blockquote>
<b>LORD POLONIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.

<b>LORD POLONIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,

	<br />
	Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,
	<br />
	Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
	<br />
	You must not take for fire. From this time
	<br />
	Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
	<br />
	Set your entreatments at a higher rate

	Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
	<br />
	Believe so much in him, that he is young
	<br />
	And with a larger tether may he walk
	<br />
	Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,

	Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
	<br />
	Not of that dye which their investments show,
	<br />
	But mere implorators of unholy suits,
	<br />
	Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,

	The better to beguile. This is for all:

	I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,

<blockquote>
	Ay, marry, is't:

	And to the manner born, it is a custom
	<br />
	More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
	<br />
	This heavy-headed revel east and west
	<br />
	Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:

	As infinite as man may undergo--

	Enter GHOST and HAMLET

<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.

<b>Ghost</b>
<blockquote>
	Mark me.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	I will.
</blockquote>
<b>Ghost</b>
<blockquote>
	My hour is almost come,
	<br />
	When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames
	<br />
	Must render up myself.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	Alas, poor ghost!
</blockquote>
<b>Ghost</b>
<blockquote>
	Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
	<br />
	To what I shall unfold.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	Speak; I am bound to hear.
</blockquote>
<b>Ghost</b>
<blockquote>
	So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	What?
</blockquote>
<b>Ghost</b>
<blockquote>
	I am thy father's spirit,
	<br />
	Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
	<br />
	And for the day confined to fast in fires,
	<br />
	Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
	<br />
	Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
	<br />
	To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
	<br />
	I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
	<br />
	Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
	<br />
	Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
	<br />
	Thy knotted and combined locks to part
	<br />
	And each particular hair to stand on end,
	<br />
	Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:
	<br />
	But this eternal blazon must not be
	<br />
	To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
	<br />
	If thou didst ever thy dear father love--
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	O God!
</blockquote>
<b>Ghost</b>
<blockquote>
	Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	Murder!
</blockquote>
<b>Ghost</b>
<blockquote>
	Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
	<br />
	But this most foul, strange and unnatural.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
	<br />
	As meditation or the thoughts of love,
	<br />
	May sweep to my revenge.
</blockquote>
<b>Ghost</b>
<blockquote>
	I find thee apt;
	<br />
	And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
	<br />
	That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
	<br />
	Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
	<br />
	'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
	<br />
	A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
	<br />
	Is by a forged process of my death
	<br />
	Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,
	<br />
	The serpent that did sting thy father's life
	<br />
	Now wears his crown.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	O my prophetic soul! My uncle!
</blockquote>
<b>Ghost</b>
<blockquote>
	Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
	<br />
	With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--
	<br />
	O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
	<br />
	So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust
	<br />
	The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
	<br />
	O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
	<br />
	From me, whose love was of that dignity
	<br />
	That it went hand in hand even with the vow
	<br />
	I made to her in marriage, and to decline
	<br />
	Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
	<br />
	To those of mine!
	<br />
	But virtue, as it never will be moved,
	<br />
	Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
	<br />
	So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
	<br />
	Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
	<br />
	And prey on garbage.
	<br />
	But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
	<br />
	Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
	<br />
	My custom always of the afternoon,
	<br />
	Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
	<br />
	With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
	<br />
	And in the porches of my ears did pour
	<br />
	The leperous distilment; whose effect
	<br />
	Holds such an enmity with blood of man
	<br />
	That swift as quicksilver it courses through
	<br />
	The natural gates and alleys of the body,
	<br />
	And with a sudden vigour doth posset
	<br />
	And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
	<br />
	The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;
	<br />
	And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
	<br />
	Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
	<br />
	All my smooth body.
	<br />
	Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
	<br />
	Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
	<br />
	Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
	<br />
	Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,
	<br />
	No reckoning made, but sent to my account
	<br />
	With all my imperfections on my head:
	<br />
	O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
	<br />
	If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
	<br />
	Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
	<br />
	A couch for luxury and damned incest.
	<br />
	But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
	<br />
	Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
	<br />
	Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven
	<br />
	And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
	<br />
	To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
	<br />
	The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
	<br />
	And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
	<br />
	Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.

</blockquote>
<b>LORD POLONIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,
	<br />
	Before you visit him, to make inquire
	<br />
	Of his behavior.
</blockquote>
<b>REYNALDO</b>
<blockquote>
	My lord, I did intend it.
</blockquote>
<b>LORD POLONIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,
	<br />
	Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
	<br />
	And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
	<br />
	What company, at what expense; and finding
	<br />
	By this encompassment and drift of question
	<br />
	That they do know my son, come you more nearer
	<br />
	Than your particular demands will touch it:
	<br />
	Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
	<br />
	As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
	<br />
	And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?
</blockquote>
<b>REYNALDO</b>
<blockquote>
	Ay, very well, my lord.

<blockquote>
	'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:
	<br />
	But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;
	<br />
	Addicted so and so:' and there put on him
	<br />
	What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
	<br />
	As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
	<br />
	But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips
	<br />
	As are companions noted and most known
	<br />
	To youth and liberty.
</blockquote>
<b>REYNALDO</b>
<blockquote>
	As gaming, my lord.
</blockquote>
<b>LORD POLONIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
	<br />
	Drabbing: you may go so far.
</blockquote>
<b>REYNALDO</b>
<blockquote>
	My lord, that would dishonour him.
</blockquote>
<b>LORD POLONIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	'Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge
	<br />
	You must not put another scandal on him,
	<br />
	That he is open to incontinency;
	<br />
	That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
	<br />
	That they may seem the taints of liberty,
	<br />
	The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
	<br />
	A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
	<br />
	Of general assault.
</blockquote>
<b>REYNALDO</b>
<blockquote>
	But, my good lord,--

<b>LORD POLONIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	Wherefore should you do this?

	Ay, my lord,
	<br />
	I would know that.
</blockquote>
<b>LORD POLONIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	Marry, sir, here's my drift;
	<br />
	And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:
	<br />
	You laying these slight sullies on my son,
	<br />
	As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,
	<br />
	Your party in converse, him you would sound,

	Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
	<br />
	The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured
	<br />
	He closes with you in this consequence;
	<br />
	'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'
	<br />
	According to the phrase or the addition
	<br />
	Of man and country.
</blockquote>
<b>REYNALDO</b>
<blockquote>
	Very good, my lord.
</blockquote>
<b>LORD POLONIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I
	<br />
	about to say? By the mass, I was about to say
	<br />
	something: where did I leave?
</blockquote>
<b>REYNALDO</b>
<blockquote>
	At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'
	<br />
	and 'gentleman.'
</blockquote>
<b>LORD POLONIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;
	<br />
	He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;
	<br />
	I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,
	<br />
	Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
	<br />
	There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
	<br />
	There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,
	<br />
	'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
	<br />
	Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
	<br />
	See you now;
	<br />
	Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
	<br />
	And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
	<br />
	With windlasses and with assays of bias,
	<br />
	By indirections find directions out:
	<br />
	So by my former lecture and advice,

	<br />
	No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,
	<br />
	Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;
	<br />
	Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
	<br />
	And with a look so piteous in purport
	<br />
	As if he had been loosed out of hell
	<br />
	To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.

<blockquote>
	My lord, I do not know;

	But truly, I do fear it.
</blockquote>
<b>LORD POLONIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	What said he?
</blockquote>
<b>OPHELIA</b>
<blockquote>
	He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
	<br />
	Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
	<br />
	And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
	<br />
	He falls to such perusal of my face
	<br />
	As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
	<br />
	At last, a little shaking of mine arm
	<br />
	And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
	<br />
	He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
	<br />
	As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
	<br />
	And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
	<br />
	And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,
	<br />
	He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
	<br />
	For out o' doors he went without their helps,
	<br />
	And, to the last, bended their light on me.
</blockquote>
<b>LORD POLONIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.
	<br />
	This is the very ecstasy of love,
	<br />
	Whose violent property fordoes itself
	<br />
	And leads the will to desperate undertakings
	<br />
	As oft as any passion under heaven
	<br />
	That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
	<br />
	What, have you given him any hard words of late?
</blockquote>
<b>OPHELIA</b>
<blockquote>
	No, my good lord, but, as you did command,

	His access to me.
</blockquote>
<b>LORD POLONIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	That hath made him mad.
	<br />
	I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
	<br />
	I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,
	<br />
	And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!
	<br />
	By heaven, it is as proper to our age
	<br />
	To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
	<br />
	As it is common for the younger sort
	<br />
	To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:
	<br />
	This must be known; which, being kept close, might
	<br />
	move
	<br />
	More grief to hide than hate to utter love.

	That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
	<br />
	Some little time: so by your companies

	To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,

	<br />
	But farewell it, for I will use no art.

	If I had play'd the desk or table-book,
	<br />
	Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
	<br />
	Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;
	<br />
	What might you think? No, I went round to work,
	<br />
	And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
	<br />
	'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;
	<br />
	This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,
	<br />
	That she should lock herself from his resort,

	Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
	<br />
	Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
	<br />
	And he, repulsed--a short tale to make--
	<br />
	Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
	<br />
	Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
	<br />
	Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,

	Into the madness wherein now he raves,

	And all we mourn for.

<blockquote>

<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	Then I would you were so honest a man.
</blockquote>
<b>LORD POLONIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	Honest, my lord!
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be
	<br />
	one man picked out of ten thousand.
</blockquote>
<b>LORD POLONIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	That's very true, my lord.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a

	<br />
	truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for
	<br />
	love; very near this. I'll speak to him again.
	<br />
	What do you read, my lord?
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
	What is the matter, my lord?

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<b>LORD POLONIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here
	<br />
	that old men have grey beards, that their faces are
	<br />
	wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and
	<br />
	plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of
	<br />
	wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,
	<br />
	though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet
	<br />
	I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for
	<br />
	yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab
	<br />
	you could go backward.
</blockquote>
<b>LORD POLONIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	[Aside] Though this be madness, yet there is method

	it is a prison.
</blockquote>
<b>ROSENCRANTZ</b>
<blockquote>
	Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too

</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count
	<br />
	myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I
	<br />
	have bad dreams.
</blockquote>
<b>GUILDENSTERN</b>
<blockquote>
	Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very

</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	A dream itself is but a shadow.
</blockquote>
<b>ROSENCRANTZ</b>
<blockquote>
	Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a

</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and

</blockquote>
<b>GUILDENSTERN</b>
<blockquote>
	What should we say, my lord?
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent

	I know the good king and queen have sent for you.
</blockquote>
<b>ROSENCRANTZ</b>
<blockquote>
	To what end, my lord?
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by
	<br />
	the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of
	<br />
	our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved
	<br />
	love, and by what more dear a better proposer could
	<br />
	charge you withal, be even and direct with me,
	<br />
	whether you were sent for, or no?
</blockquote>
<b>ROSENCRANTZ</b>
<blockquote>
	[Aside to GUILDENSTERN] What say you?
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	[Aside] Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you
	<br />
	love me, hold not off.
</blockquote>
<b>GUILDENSTERN</b>
<blockquote>
	My lord, we were sent for.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation
	<br />
	prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king
	<br />
	and queen moult no feather. I have of late--but
	<br />
	wherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all
	<br />
	custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily
	<br />
	with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
	<br />
	earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most
	<br />
	excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave
	<br />
	o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted
	<br />
	with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to
	<br />
	me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.
	<br />
	What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!
	<br />
	how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how
	<br />
	express and admirable! in action how like an angel!
	<br />
	in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the
	<br />
	world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,
	<br />
	what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not
	<br />
	me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling
	<br />
	you seem to say so.
</blockquote>
<b>ROSENCRANTZ</b>
<blockquote>
	My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?
</blockquote>
<b>ROSENCRANTZ</b>
<blockquote>
	To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what
	<br />
	lenten entertainment the players shall receive from
	<br />
	you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they
	<br />
	coming, to offer you service.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty
	<br />
	shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight
	<br />
	shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not
	<br />
	sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part
	<br />
	in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
	<br />
	lungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall
	<br />
	say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt
	<br />
	for't. What players are they?
</blockquote>
<b>ROSENCRANTZ</b>
<blockquote>
	Even those you were wont to take delight in, the
	<br />
	tragedians of the city.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	How chances it they travel? their residence, both
	<br />
	in reputation and profit, was better both ways.
</blockquote>
<b>ROSENCRANTZ</b>
<blockquote>
	I think their inhibition comes by the means of the
	<br />
	late innovation.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was
	<br />
	in the city? are they so followed?

<b>ROSENCRANTZ</b>
<blockquote>
	No, indeed, are they not.

<blockquote>
	What speech, my lord?

<blockquote>
	I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was

	never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the
	<br />
	play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas
	<br />
	caviare to the general: but it was--as I received
	<br />
	it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
	<br />
	cried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well
	<br />
	digested in the scenes, set down with as much
	<br />
	modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there
	<br />
	were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
	<br />
	savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might
	<br />
	indict the author of affectation; but called it an
	<br />
	honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very
	<br />
	much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I
	<br />
	chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and
	<br />
	thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of
	<br />
	Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin
	<br />
	at this line: let me see, let me see--
	<br />
	'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--
	<br />
	it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--
	<br />
	'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
	<br />
	Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
	<br />
	When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
	<br />
	Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
	<br />
	With heraldry more dismal; head to foot
	<br />
	Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd
	<br />
	With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
	<br />
	Baked and impasted with the parching streets,
	<br />
	That lend a tyrannous and damned light
	<br />
	To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,
	<br />
	And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,
	<br />
	With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
	<br />
	Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
	<br />
	So, proceed you.

	<br />

	<br />
	Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;
	<br />
	But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
	<br />
	The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
	<br />
	Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
	<br />
	Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
	<br />
	Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,
	<br />
	Which was declining on the milky head
	<br />
	Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:
	<br />
	So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,

	As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder

	And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
	<br />
	On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne

	<br />
	Now falls on Priam.

	O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
	<br />
	Is it not monstrous that this player here,
	<br />
	But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
	<br />
	Could force his soul so to his own conceit
	<br />
	That from her working all his visage wann'd,
	<br />
	Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
	<br />
	A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
	<br />
	With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!
	<br />
	For Hecuba!
	<br />
	What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
	<br />
	That he should weep for her? What would he do,
	<br />
	Had he the motive and the cue for passion
	<br />

	A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
	<br />
	Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
	<br />
	And can say nothing; no, not for a king,
	<br />
	Upon whose property and most dear life
	<br />
	A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
	<br />
	Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
	<br />
	Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?

	<br />
	Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
	<br />
	Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,
	<br />
	And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,
	<br />
	A scullion!
	<br />
	Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard
	<br />
	That guilty creatures sitting at a play
	<br />
	Have by the very cunning of the scene
	<br />
	Been struck so to the soul that presently
	<br />
	They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
	<br />
	For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
	<br />
	With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players
	<br />
	Play something like the murder of my father
	<br />
	Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
	<br />
	I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
	<br />
	I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
	<br />
	May be the devil: and the devil hath power
	<br />
	To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
	<br />
	Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
	<br />
	As he is very potent with such spirits,
	<br />
	Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds
	<br />
	More relative than this: the play 's the thing
	<br />
	Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.

	Must give us pause: there's the respect
	<br />
	That makes calamity of so long life;
	<br />
	For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
	<br />
	The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
	<br />
	The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
	<br />
	The insolence of office and the spurns
	<br />
	That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
	<br />
	When he himself might his quietus make
	<br />
	With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
	<br />
	To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
	<br />
	But that the dread of something after death,
	<br />
	The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
	<br />
	No traveller returns, puzzles the will
	<br />
	And makes us rather bear those ills we have
	<br />
	Than fly to others that we know not of?
	<br />
	Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
	<br />
	And thus the native hue of resolution
	<br />
	Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
	<br />
	And enterprises of great pith and moment
	<br />
	With this regard their currents turn awry,
	<br />
	And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
	<br />
	The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
	<br />
	Be all my sins remember'd.

	No, not I;

	My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
	<br />
	And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed
	<br />
	As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,
	<br />
	Take these again; for to the noble mind

	Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.

	admit no discourse to your beauty.
</blockquote>
<b>OPHELIA</b>
<blockquote>
	Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than
	<br />
	with honesty?
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner
	<br />
	transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the
	<br />
	force of honesty can translate beauty into his
	<br />
	likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the
	<br />
	time gives it proof. I did love you once.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
	Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot
	<br />
	so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of

<blockquote>
	I was the more deceived.

<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a
	<br />
	breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;
	<br />
	but yet I could accuse me of such things that it
	<br />
	were better my mother had not borne me: I am very
	<br />
	proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at
	<br />
	my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,
	<br />
	imagination to give them shape, or time to act them
	<br />
	in. What should such fellows as I do crawling
	<br />
	between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,
	<br />
	all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.

<blockquote>
	If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for

	snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a
	<br />
	nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs
	<br />
	marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough
	<br />
	what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go,

	Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
	<br />
	It is a damned ghost that we have seen,

	And my imaginations are as foul

	As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;

	The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
	<br />

	<br />
	Their own enactures with themselves destroy:
	<br />
	Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
	<br />
	Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
	<br />
	This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange

	Look here, upon this picture, and on this,
	<br />
	The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
	<br />
	See, what a grace was seated on this brow;
	<br />
	Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
	<br />
	An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
	<br />
	A station like the herald Mercury
	<br />
	New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;
	<br />
	A combination and a form indeed,
	<br />
	Where every god did seem to set his seal,
	<br />
	To give the world assurance of a man:
	<br />
	This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:
	<br />
	Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,
	<br />
	Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
	<br />
	Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
	<br />
	And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
	<br />
	You cannot call it love; for at your age
	<br />
	The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
	<br />
	And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment
	<br />
	Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,
	<br />
	Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense
	<br />
	Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
	<br />
	Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd
	<br />
	But it reserved some quantity of choice,
	<br />
	To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
	<br />
	That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
	<br />
	Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
	<br />
	Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
	<br />
	Or but a sickly part of one true sense
	<br />
	Could not so mope.
	<br />
	O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
	<br />
	If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
	<br />
	To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
	<br />
	And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame
	<br />
	When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
	<br />
	Since frost itself as actively doth burn
	<br />
	And reason panders will.

	Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
	<br />
	Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
	<br />
	Which is not tomb enough and continent
	<br />
	To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,

	them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so
	<br />
	I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with
	<br />
	me like thieves of mercy: but they knew what they
	<br />
	did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the king

	have the letters I have sent; and repair thou to me
	<br />
	with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I

	have words to speak in thine ear will make thee
	<br />
	dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of
	<br />
	the matter. These good fellows will bring thee
	<br />
	where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their

	course for England: of them I have much to tell
	<br />
	thee. Farewell.
	<br />
	'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'

<h3>SCENE VII. Another room in the castle.</h3> 
<blockquote class="c1">
	Enter KING CLAUDIUS and LAERTES 
</blockquote>
<b>KING CLAUDIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,
	<br />
	And you must put me in your heart for friend,
	<br />
	Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
	<br />
	That he which hath your noble father slain
	<br />
	Pursued my life.
</blockquote>
<b>LAERTES</b>
<blockquote>
	It well appears: but tell me
	<br />
	Why you proceeded not against these feats,
	<br />
	So crimeful and so capital in nature,
	<br />
	As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
	<br />
	You mainly were stirr'd up.
</blockquote>
<b>KING CLAUDIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	O, for two special reasons;
	<br />
	Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
	<br />
	But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother
	<br />
	Lives almost by his looks; and for myself--
	<br />
	My virtue or my plague, be it either which--
	<br />
	She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,
	<br />
	That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
	<br />
	I could not but by her. The other motive,
	<br />
	Why to a public count I might not go,
	<br />
	Is the great love the general gender bear him;
	<br />
	Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
	<br />
	Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
	<br />
	Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,
	<br />
	Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
	<br />
	Would have reverted to my bow again,
	<br />
	And not where I had aim'd them.
</blockquote>
<b>LAERTES</b>
<blockquote>
	And so have I a noble father lost;
	<br />
	A sister driven into desperate terms,
	<br />
	Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
	<br />
	Stood challenger on mount of all the age
	<br />
	For her perfections: but my revenge will come.
</blockquote>
<b>KING CLAUDIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think
	<br />
	That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
	<br />
	That we can let our beard be shook with danger
	<br />
	And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:
	<br />
	I loved your father, and we love ourself;
	<br />
	And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine--
	<br />
	<p class="c2">

<blockquote>
	From Hamlet! who brought them?

	I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;
	<br />
	It warms the very sickness in my heart,
	<br />
	That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
	<br />
	'Thus didest thou.'
</blockquote>
<b>KING CLAUDIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	If it be so, Laertes--
	<br />

	Will you be ruled by me?

<b>LAERTES</b>
<blockquote>
	Ay, my lord;
	<br />
	So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
</blockquote>
<b>KING CLAUDIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,
	<br />
	As checking at his voyage, and that he means
	<br />
	No more to undertake it, I will work him
	<br />
	To an exploit, now ripe in my device,
	<br />
	Under the which he shall not choose but fall:
	<br />
	And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,
	<br />
	But even his mother shall uncharge the practise
	<br />
	And call it accident.
</blockquote>
<b>LAERTES</b>
<blockquote>
	My lord, I will be ruled;
	<br />
	The rather, if you could devise it so
	<br />
	That I might be the organ.
</blockquote>
<b>KING CLAUDIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	It falls right.
	<br />
	You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
	<br />
	And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
	<br />
	Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts
	<br />
	Did not together pluck such envy from him
	<br />
	As did that one, and that, in my regard,
	<br />
	Of the unworthiest siege.
</blockquote>
<b>LAERTES</b>
<blockquote>
	What part is that, my lord?
</blockquote>
<b>KING CLAUDIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	A very riband in the cap of youth,
	<br />
	Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes
	<br />
	The light and careless livery that it wears
	<br />
	Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
	<br />
	Importing health and graveness. Two months since,
	<br />
	Here was a gentleman of Normandy:--
	<br />
	I've seen myself, and served against, the French,
	<br />
	And they can well on horseback: but this gallant
	<br />
	Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;
	<br />
	And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,
	<br />
	As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured
	<br />
	With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,
	<br />
	That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
	<br />
	Come short of what he did.
</blockquote>
<b>LAERTES</b>
<blockquote>
	A Norman was't?
</blockquote>
<b>KING CLAUDIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	A Norman.
</blockquote>
<b>LAERTES</b>
<blockquote>
	Upon my life, Lamond.
</blockquote>
<b>KING CLAUDIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	The very same.
</blockquote>
<b>LAERTES</b>
<blockquote>
	I know him well: he is the brooch indeed
	<br />
	And gem of all the nation.
</blockquote>
<b>KING CLAUDIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	He made confession of you,
	<br />
	And gave you such a masterly report
	<br />
	For art and exercise in your defence
	<br />
	And for your rapier most especially,
	<br />
	That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,
	<br />
	If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,
	<br />
	He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
	<br />
	If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his
	<br />
	Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
	<br />
	That he could nothing do but wish and beg
	<br />
	Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.
	<br />
	Now, out of this,--
</blockquote>
<b>LAERTES</b>
<blockquote>
	What out of this, my lord?
</blockquote>
<b>KING CLAUDIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	Laertes, was your father dear to you?
	<br />
	Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
	<br />
	A face without a heart?
</blockquote>
<b>LAERTES</b>
<blockquote>
	Why ask you this?
</blockquote>
<b>KING CLAUDIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	Not that I think you did not love your father;
	<br />
	But that I know love is begun by time;
	<br />
	And that I see, in passages of proof,
	<br />
	Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
	<br />
	There lives within the very flame of love
	<br />
	A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
	<br />
	And nothing is at a like goodness still;
	<br />
	For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
	<br />
	Dies in his own too much: that we would do
	<br />
	We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes
	<br />
	And hath abatements and delays as many
	<br />
	As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
	<br />
	And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
	<br />
	That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:--
	<br />
	Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,
	<br />
	To show yourself your father's son in deed
	<br />
	More than in words?
</blockquote>
<b>LAERTES</b>
<blockquote>
	To cut his throat i' the church.
</blockquote>
<b>KING CLAUDIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;
	<br />
	Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
	<br />
	Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.
	<br />
	Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:
	<br />
	We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
	<br />
	And set a double varnish on the fame
	<br />
	The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together
	<br />
	And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,
	<br />
	Most generous and free from all contriving,
	<br />
	Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,
	<br />
	Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
	<br />
	A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise
	<br />
	Requite him for your father.
</blockquote>
<b>LAERTES</b>
<blockquote>
	I will do't:
	<br />
	And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.
	<br />
	I bought an unction of a mountebank,
	<br />
	So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
	<br />
	Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
	<br />
	Collected from all simples that have virtue
	<br />
	Under the moon, can save the thing from death
	<br />
	That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point
	<br />
	With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
	<br />
	It may be death.
</blockquote>
<b>KING CLAUDIUS</b>
<blockquote>
	Let's further think of this;
	<br />
	Weigh what convenience both of time and means
	<br />
	May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,
	<br />
	And that our drift look through our bad performance,
	<br />
	'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project
	<br />
	Should have a back or second, that might hold,
	<br />
	If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:
	<br />
	We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't.
	<br />
	When in your motion you are hot and dry--
	<br />
	As make your bouts more violent to that end--
	<br />
	And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him
	<br />
	A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,
	<br />
	If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,

	Our purpose may hold there.

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<b>QUEEN GERTRUDE</b>
<blockquote>
	There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
	<br />
	That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;

	There with fantastic garlands did she come
	<br />
	Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples
	<br />
	That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
	<br />
	But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:
	<br />
	There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds
	<br />
	Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;
	<br />
	When down her weedy trophies and herself
	<br />
	Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;
	<br />
	And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:
	<br />
	Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;
	<br />
	As one incapable of her own distress,
	<br />
	Or like a creature native and indued
	<br />
	Unto that element: but long it could not be
	<br />
	Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
	<br />
	Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
	<br />
	To muddy death.

<b>LAERTES</b>
<blockquote>
	Alas, then, she is drown'd?
</blockquote>
<b>QUEEN GERTRUDE</b>
<blockquote>
	Drown'd, drown'd.

	Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,

	that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.

<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	How long is that since?
</blockquote>
<b>First Clown</b>
<blockquote>
	Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it
	<br />
	was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that
	<br />
	is mad, and sent into England.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?
</blockquote>
<b>First Clown</b>
<blockquote>
	Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits
	<br />
	there; or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	Why?
</blockquote>
<b>First Clown</b>
<blockquote>
	'Twill, a not be seen in him there; there the men
	<br />
	are as mad as he.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	How came he mad?
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
	Very strangely, they say.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
	How strangely?
</blockquote>
<b>First Clown</b>
<blockquote>
	Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	Upon what ground?
</blockquote>
<b>First Clown</b>
<blockquote>
	Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man
	<br />
	and boy, thirty years.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?
</blockquote>
<b>First Clown</b>
<blockquote>
	I' faith, if he be not rotten before he die--as we
	<br />
	have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce
	<br />
	hold the laying in--he will last you some eight year
	<br />
	or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	Why he more than another?
</blockquote>
<b>First Clown</b>
<blockquote>
	Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that
	<br />
	he will keep out water a great while; and your water
	<br />
	is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.
	<br />
	Here's a skull now; this skull has lain in the earth
	<br />
	three and twenty years.

<blockquote>
	Whose was it?

<blockquote>
	A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?
</blockquote>
<b>HAMLET</b>
<blockquote>
	Nay, I know not.
</blockquote>
<b>First Clown</b>
<blockquote>
	A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a' poured a
	<br />

	<br />
	borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how
	<br />
	abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims at

	it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know

	not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your

	gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment,
	<br />
	that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one

	now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen?
	<br />
	Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let
	<br />

	That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,

	<br />
	A baseness to write fair and labour'd much

<blockquote>
	An earnest conjuration from the king,

	<br />
	Folded the writ up in form of the other,
