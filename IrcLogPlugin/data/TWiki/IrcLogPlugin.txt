renders a chunk of text 

this is just a prototype/proof of concept.  it needs to support parameters like =web= and =topic=, an arbitrary url (=href=?), perhaps some prepackaged css stylesheets for the rendered log.  maybe some sort of filtering?  plus, it would be nice for the rendering to show timestamps, which it currently ignores.  stuff like that...

other suggestions for improvements:
	* (optionally and/or by default) mask ip addresses
	* merge multiple lines into a single block
