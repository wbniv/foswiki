---+!! MacrosPlugin

Lets you use parameterised includes in TWiki. This plugin supports tags originally included with the TWiki:Plugins/FormQueryPlugin, but now split out for clarity.

---+ Features
	* Macros defined in topics
	* Topic-scope SET function
	* Strip newlines from macro topics

---+ Syntax Rules
---++ <code>%<nop>CALLMACRO{...}%</code>

<code>%CALLMACRO</code> is used to include a macro defined in a topic in the current web immediately, as if it were simply typed in the topic. It is like =%<nop>INCLUDE%= except that parameters can be passed in and expanded in the included text.

A macro is defined by creating a topic that contains the macro body. For example, a topic named =MacroMaturity= may contain the text:
<verbatim>
The science of %science% is %state%
</verbatim>
This macro can be included in another topic using <code>%CALLMACRO</code> :
<pre>
%<nop>CALLMACRO{topic=MacroMaturity science="biology" state="mature"}%
%<nop>CALLMACRO{topic=MacroMaturity science="nanotechnology" state="in its infancy"}%
</pre>
With fairly obvious results. Note that standard TWiki variables such as <code>%<nop>TOPIC%</code> are expanded with the values of _the calling topic_ and not the macro topic. Macro parameter expansions take precedence over any TWiki variable or =%SET= value for the same name.
---+++ <code>%STRIP</code>
To support the inclusion of macros that don't generate any text (e.g. macros containing only <code>%FORMQUERY</code> and <code>%TABLEFORMAT</code>) then the special tag <code>%<nop>STRIP%</code> can be included in the macro text. If this is seen, all newlines will be stripped from the macro before it is included in the calling topic. The <code>%STRIP</code> tag only works in the context of a macro body.
---++ <code>%SET</code> pseudo-tag
<code>%SET</code> is called a pseudo-tag because it doesn't operate the same way as normal twiki tags; it generates no output, and is delimited by end-of line.

<code>%SET</code> is used to set a variable value within the context of the current topic. Variable values which are set remain in force only within the current topic, or until the variable is set to a new value. Note that variable values =%SET= within a =%CALLMACRO= are available in the calling topic.

<code>%SET</code> tags *must* occur at the start of a line (no leading spaces) and are terminated by the end of line. For example,
<pre>
%<nop>SET X = 1000
</pre>
will set =%<nop>X%= to 1000 for the rest of the topic.

Another difference from standard Set is that the RHS of a <code>%SET</code> is fully evaluated immediately. This means that it is unlike a macro, and more like an assignment expression in a programming language. For example,
<pre>
%<nop>SET X = 1000
%<nop>SET Y = 100
%<nop>SET Z = %CALC{"%<nop>X% / %<nop>Y%"}%
</pre>
will set =%<nop>Z%= to the string =10= and NOT the string <code>"%<nop>CALC{"1000 / 100"}%"</code>. This is a critically important difference; values that are <code>%SET</code> can be used alongside plugins (such as SpreadSheetPlugin) that are very sensitive to format.
