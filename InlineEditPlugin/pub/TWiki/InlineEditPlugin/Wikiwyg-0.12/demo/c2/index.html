Using Greasemonkey, I was able to show Ward Cunningham, the father of wiki,
what his famous c2.com wiki would look like with Wikiwyg. Ward liked the idea,
and is looking forward to installing it for real in the near future.

You can try it at home:

    <li>Use Firefox
    <li>Install <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/changes/0.5.html">Greasemonkey 0.5</a>
    <li>Install this <a href="wikiwyg-c2.user.js">user script</a>
    <li>Visit <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WardsWiki">Ward's Wiki</a>
    <li>Doubleclick on the page
</ol>

Note: You can't save changes yet. This is just a proof of concept spike.
