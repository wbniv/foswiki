%TOC%

This is the supplemental plugin for the BlogUp <nop>TWikiApplication.
It bundles some of the features found in common blogging applications 
that are very hard or even impossible to implement using <nop>TWikiML. 
Note, that most of the tags are tightly related to the
data model of BlogUp, i.e. it relies on its <nop>TopicType and <nop>DataForm 
definitions. 

Shortcut: want to create a blog ... use the BlogFactory.

---++ Syntax Rules

---+++ CITEBLOG
Format a link to another <nop>BlogEntry displaying its headline and date.

*Syntax:*

| *%<nop>CITEBLOG{"&lt;topic>"}%* ||
| ="&lt;topic>"= | name of a <nop>BlogEntry topic, e.g. <nop>BlogEntry0 |

*Example:*

=%<nop>CITEBLOG{"_BlogPlugin.BlogEntry0"}%=

%CITEBLOG{"_BlogPlugin.BlogEntry0"}%


---+++ COUNTCOMMENTS
Count the <nop>BlogComments that refer to a given topic recursively, that is
the number of <nop>BlogComment topics that refer to a given <nop>BlogEntry and 
each <nop>BlogComment referring to the <nop>BlogComment found so far. Reference
is expressed by the <nop>BlogRef formfield in the <nop>BlogCommentForm.

*Syntax:*
| *%<nop>COUNTCOMMENTS{"&lt;topic>" ... }%* ||
| ="&lt;topic>"= \
| name of a <nop>BlogEntry or <nop>BlogComment topic, e.g. <nop>BlogEntry0 |
| =web="..."= \
| web where to search for references; defaults to the \
  web specified as part of the "topic" parameter or the current one |
| =format="..."= \
| format string used to display the count; \
  the variable $count is replaced by the calculated references; \
  defaults to "$count" |
| =single="..."= \
| format string used to display a single hit; \
  defaults to the "format" value (see above) |
| =null="..."= \
| format string used to display a zero hit; defaults to "0" |
| =hidenull="on,off"= \
| if set to "on" nohting is displayed if no references where found; \
  defaults to "off" |
| =offset="..."= \
| add an "offset" to the computed number of hits; so if offset="9" and \
  11 references where found the $count is set to 20 |

Following variables are expanded in format strings:
   * $percnt: % sign
   * $dollar: $ sign
   * $n: newline
   * $t: tab
   * $nop: "empty string"
   * $count: the calculated number of references (plus an optional offset)


---+++ PREVDOC, NEXTDOC
Display the previous/next topic in an ordered set.
These tags can be used to establish a navigation within a set of related topics
paging to the preceding or succeeding one. A set of related topics is defined
using a "where" and an "order" clause which the given topic is supposed to be part of.

*Syntax:*
| *%<nop>PREVDOC{"&lt;topic" where="..." ...}%, %<nop>NEXTDOC{"&lt;topic" where="..." ...}%* ||
| ="&lt;topic>"= | topic which we search the predecessor/successor of |
| =web="..."= | web where to search for related topics; \
  defaults to the web given with the &lt;topic> parameter or the current one |
| =where="..."= \
| search clause, see documentation of the DBCacheContrib |
| =order="..."= \
| document property used to sort the hit set; defaults to "created" |
| =reverse="on,off"= \
| if set to on the sorting will be reversed, that is the logic of PREV and NEXT is inverted |


---+++ RECENTCOMMENTS
Display an ordered list of most recent <nop>BlogComments, grouped by the
referred <nop>BlogEntry.

*Syntax:*
| *%<nop>RECENTCOMMENTS{"&lt;format>" ...}%* ||
| ="&lt;format>"= | format string used to display the hit results; \
  each hit is displayed using the given format |
| =header="..."= | format string to prepended to the list of hits being displayed |
| =footer="..."= | format string to appended to the list of hits being displayed |
| =separator="..."= | format string used to separate hits; \
  defaults top "$n"; the special separator "none" disables separation |
| =limit="..."= | restrict the number of hits being displayed; \
  defaults to "-1" which means unlimited |
| =age="..."= | restrict the age of comments being displayed; \
  values must be given in epoch seconds, e.g. 5184000 being ca. 2 months; \
  defaults to "0" which means unlimited |
| =category="..."= \
| pattern that limits comments to those whose <nop>BlogEntries match the \
  <nop>SubjectCategory; defaults to ".*" |
| =author="..."= \
| pattern that limits comments to those on <nop>BlogEntries from the given author \
  defaults to ".*" |

(Each <nop>BlogEntry that is found given the above search parameters and limits
is called a hit.)

Following variables are expanded in format strings:
   * $percnt: % sign
   * $dollar: $ sign
   * $n: newline
   * $t: tab
   * $nop: "empty string"
   * $count: the number of comments on the given <nop>BlogEntry
   * $topic: the topic name of the referring <nop>BlogEntry, e.g. <nop>BlogEntry0
   * $web: the web where the hit was found
   * $headline: the headline of the referring <nop>BlogEntry 
   * $commenter: a list of links to the comments in the format \
      [<nop>[BlogEntry0#BlogComment1][&lt;author>]],... (author: name of
      commenter)
   * $date: date of the most recent comment on the current hit.

See also the interface <nop>TopicFunction "RenderRecentComments". 

---+++ RELATEDENTRIES
Display a list of <nop>BlogEntries related to a given one. The Relationship
is manually encoded in the data model using the "Related" formfield. The
relation is computed transitively and reflexively ('til a configurable depth).
That is, two <nop>BlogEntries A and B are related if A points to B or vice versa
or A and B are connected by a series of related postings C1,...CN, where A is related 
to C1 and B CN is related to B.

*Syntax:*
| *%<nop>RELATEDENTRIES{"&lt;topic>" ...}%* ||
| ="&lt;topic>"= | topic name of a <nop>BlogEntry related once are search for |
| =web="..."= | web where to search for related topics; \
  defaults to the web given with the &lt;topic> parameter or the current one |
| =format="..."= | format string to display a hit;\
  defaults to "$topic" |
| =header="..."= | format string to prepended to the list of hits |
| =footer="..."= | format string to appended to the list of hits |
| =separator="..."= | format string used to separate hits; \
  defaults to "$n"; the special separator "none" disables separation |
| =depth="..."= | depth of recursion (the number of hops from posting A to posting B); \
  defaults to "2"; |

Note, that large "depth" values will very soon include your complete blog archive.
The hit set also depends on the amount of direct relationships that you add to your
<nop>BlogEntries. So either use a low "depth" value and add more direct relations based on
your own judgment, or just specify one related entry and use a "depth" value of up to
3 for good results.

Following variables are expanded in format strings:
   * $percnt: % sign
   * $dollar: $ sign
   * $n: newline
   * $t: tab
   * $topic: topic name of a hit
   * $web: web name where the hit was found
   * $depth: distance to the given &lt;topic> (depth in which this topic was found)
   * $headline: headline of the related <nop>BlogEntry

The relatedness feature here is a very na&iuml;ve and purely manual one.
We'd like to semi-automate this task using some automatic classificator
on document similarities. Making use of weights following links is an option too to
improve the hit set quality.
