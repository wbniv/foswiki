TWiki (TM) - A Web Based Collaboration Platform
===============================================

What is TWiki?
--------------

TWiki is a flexible and powerful web-based collaboration 
platform that allows you to run a dynamic intranet site, a 
project development space, a document management system, a 
knowledge base, an issue tracking system and many other

intranet or Web site. Users can freely change or create 
content from any Web browser, without requiring special 
browser plugins. 

Major companies like British Telecom, Sun Microsystems, 
Motorola and SAP depend on the TWiki platform to increase 
the productivity of their engineering teams. 

Features include automatic link generation, full text 
search, authorization based on groups, Web form handling, 
email notification of changes, file attachments to Web 
pages, revision control of pages and attachments, and 
more. The server-side TWiki Plugins API provides developers 
with a simple way to build new groupware applications. 

The GPLed TWiki software and over hundreds of Plugins can be 
downloaded from the TWiki.org web site, http://TWiki.org/.
