---+ ToPDF AddOn *beta!
This addons converts TWiki topics into PDF`s. Comparing to GenPDF or others, its main goal yet is to support CSS as far as possible and therefore the PDF should just look like the original topic.
In addition it supports to render the topic in a diffrrent template before generating the PDF to customize the topic, remove anything not needed or just adjust the "printing" view to paper.

This AddOn was based on GenPDF

---++ Usage
   * as backend it uses html2pdf, a php5 script to convert html files into PDFs. It supports CSS 2.0 and even float content.
