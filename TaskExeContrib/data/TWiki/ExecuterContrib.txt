---++ Purpose & scope 

The task executer is running on a remote machine executing a task. It is a key concept of the %SYSTEMWEB%.TaskExeContrib.
Here we describe how to set-up and use an executer machine. We also provide technical information about the executer implementation.

---++ Installation instructions

DO NOT install on a TWiki server. <br />
The task executer is typically set-up on a remote machine where it runs as a __Linux service__ or __Windows service__.

---+++ MS Windows executer set-up

In the following set-up instructions paths and command lines are given as examples and should be altered according to your machine settings. 

   1 Set-up a web server. Preferably Apache 2.2.
   1 Install the executer using the [[%ATTACHURL%/ExecuterSetup.msi][Windows installer]] provided.
   1 Fix the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_%28Unix%29][Shebang line]] in the CGI =exestart= and =exestatus=.
   1 Copy the folder =c:\executer\cgi-bin\executer= to your web server =cgi-bin= directory. 
   1 Set the credentials for accessing your TWiki web site in =c:\executer\cfg\executer.cfg=.  
   1 Set the =smtphost= in =c:\executer\cfg\executer.cfg= for =SENDMAIL= command.
   1 Run the Executer:
      * In a console:
         * Open a console. Go to =c:\executer\bin\executer= and run =perl executer.pl=.
      * As a Windows service:
         * You can use [[https://slion.net/view/Dev/ExeService][ExeService]] to set it up for you. 
         * Double check the service's _Log On_ information. Maybe you want to use specific user to gain write access to your TWiki pages.

__Note:__ When using MS Windows operating system as a build server you may want to prevent long running process to freeze on a dialog box:
   1 [[http://www.support.microsoft.com/kb/229012/en-us/][Disable Windows modal dialog box]] that can potentially freeze the executer.
   1 Restart your machine if you have updated the MS Windows registry.

---+++ Linux executer set-up

   1 Set-up a web server. Preferably Apache 2.2.
   1 Install the =zip= or =tgz= provided in your home directory. 
   1 Fix the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_%28Unix%29][Shebang line]] in the CGI =exestart= and =exestatus=.
   1 Set the credentials for accessing your TWiki web site in =~/executer/cfg/executer.cfg=  
   1 Run the executer:
      * In a console:
         * Open a console. Go to =~/executer/bin/executer= and run =perl executer.pl=.

---+++ Executer registration

Once your machine is set-up [[ExecuterRegistration][register your executer]].

---+++ Executer troubleshooting

If you are experiencing problems with an Executer you should:
   * Check login/password in =executer.cfg=
   * Check login/password of the Executer Windows service
   * Delete files in =c:\executer=. DO NOT delete the directories in =c:\executer=.
   * Try to run it in console instead of Windows service

---++ System documentation

*\lib\Slion\bin\executer.pl* - Infinite loop using !Slion::TWiki::Executer and waiting for task request from web server. <br />
*\lib\Slion\TWiki\Executer.pm* - Sub class !Slion::TWiki::Client adding functionalities for parsing a Task topic and and executing Commands <br />
*\lib\Slion\TWiki\Client.pm* - Provides API for reading and writing topics from a TWiki web site <br />
*\cgi-bin\executer\exestatus* - CGI, output some Javascript for automatic status update from web page. <br />
*\cgi-bin\executer\exestart* - CGI, used to trigger a [[%SYSTEMWEB%.TaskExeContrib#Task][Task]].
