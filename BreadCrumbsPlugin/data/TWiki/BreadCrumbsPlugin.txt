---++ Description
This plugin helps you to locate where you are, and shows you how
you can escape from there using breadcrumbs navigation.

Two types of breadcrumb are supported; "location" breadcrumbs, which show you
where you are in the site hierarchy, taking into account topic parent relationships, and "path" breadcrumbs, that simply show you where you have been, but without going in circles.

In a way, location breadcrumbs have always been supported by TWiki using the
=META{"parent"}= variable to display the list of parent topics. Since version
4.x  TWiki also supports hierarchical subwebs, but the breadcrumbs support of
TWiki does not allow the display of parent webs as part of of the location
breadcrumbs.

Path breadcrumbs show you which topics you visited to reach the current topic. If you revisit a topic you visited earlier, the path is trimmed back to that topic, so it gives you a sort of visual history of where you have been on the site. Path breadcrumbs require that you have session support enabled.

The plugin also gives a great deal of flexibility in deciding which
parts of the breadcrumbs should be rendered, and how each
individual breadcrumb is displayed.

---++ Configuration
While most settings are given as part of the =BREADCRUMBS= tag, there are a few settings
to improve rendering breadcrumbs.

---+++ Enabling Path breadcrumbs
To switch on recording the path breadcrumbs, set the =BREADCRUMBSPLUGIN_RECORDTRAIL= to =on=.
Otherwise the click path of the user won't be recorded and the =type= setting to the
BREADCRUMBS will result in an undefined behaviour.

---+++ Displaying !TopicTitles
!TopicTitles are a concept introduced by the TWiki:Plugins/DBCachePlugin. These are stored
in a topic in the =TOPICTITLE= preference variable or in a formfield 'TopicTitle ' of a !TWikiForm attached to the topic. If a !TopicTitle is defined for a topicm, it will be displayed in the breadcrumbs instead of the normal !WikiWord topic name. For efficiency it is recommended to install the TWiki:Plugins/DBCachePlugin to determine the !TopicTitle.

---++ Syntax
=%<nop>BREADCRUMBS%, %<nop>BREADCRUMBS{"&lt;web>.&lt;topic>" ...}%=

*Parameters*:
   * =&lt;web>.&lt;topic>=: the location to which breadcrumbs should be generated (type="location" only, ignored if type="path")
     defaults to the current topic
   * =type=: "location" (the default) or "path"
   * =header=: format string prepended to the output result
   * =format=: format string to render one item on the breadcrumbs path
     (defaults to '[<nop>[$webtopic][$name]]')
   * =topicformat=: format string for any _topic_ items on the path; for example, parent topics. Defaults to the same as =format=.
   * =footer=: format string appended to the output result
   * =separator=: format string to be put between items
     (defaults to one space char)
   * =include=: regular expression that items must match to be part of the path
   * =exclude=: regular expression that items must _not_ match to be part of the path
   * =recurse=:  (type="location" only)can be one or more of the following values (comma separated) to
     decide which parts of the breadcrumbs path should be included (defaults to 'on'):
      * =on=: include all parent webs and all parent topics
      * =off=: include only the current web and the current topic
      * =weboff=: don't recurse on webs, include only the current web
      * =topicoff=: don't recurse on topics, include only the current topic
      * =webonce=: include the next parent web but not the parent web's parent web
      * =topiconce=: include the next parent topic but not the parent topic's parent topic
      * =once=: short formf of =webonce, topiconce=
   * =spaceout=: space out !WikiWords inserting a separator (defaults to 'off')
   * =spaceoutsep=: separator to be used when spacing out !WikiWords
   * =maxlength=: maximum length of a breadcrumbs before inserting an ellipsis in the middle,
     0 meaning disable this feature (defaults to 0)
   * =ellipsis=: character sequence to be inserted when reducing the maxlength of the breadcrumbs
     (defaults to ' ... ')

*Pseudo-variables*: %BR%
Each of the above format strings (format, header, footer,
separator) may contain special variables:
   * =$name=: the name of the breadcrumb, this is the topic name or the web name having its
     parent web part being stripped off (that is =Bar= instead of =Sandbox/Foo/Bar=)
   * =$webtopic=: the full =web.topic= of the breadcrumb (twiki syntax)
   * =$target=: the full =web/topic= of the breadcrumb (url syntax)
   * =$name=: name of the breadcrumbs item this is the !TopicTitle, spaced out or normal topic name
     topic
   * =$n=: replaced with a newline char (\n)
   * =$percnt=: replaced with a percent char (%)
   * =$dollar=: replaced with a dollar char ($)
   * =$nop=: removed from the format string before expanding common TWiki variables
