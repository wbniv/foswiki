---+ <nop>%TOPIC%

Use the ==#<nop>#.==, ==#<nop>#..== _etc._ notation to insert outline numbering sequences (1, 1.1, 2, 2.1) in topic's text. 

Use ==---#<nop>==, ==---#<nop>#==, _etc._, to generate numbered headings.

---++ Syntax Rules

---+++ Numbered sequences

   * The default outline numbering sequence uses the notation =#<nop>#...= (with 1-6 dots). The notation is replaced anywhere in the topic. The level number corresponding to the number of dots increases with each use. Each time a level is used, all higher levels are reset to 0.
   * Named numbering sequences can be used with the notation =#<nop>#name#...= for sequence =name=. Named sequences have independent numbering.
   * The numbering of a sequence can be initialized or re-initialized by adding a number =n= into the tag. For example, =#<nop>#name#2...= resets numbering sequence =name= to =2=. The sequence is initialized from the indicated level on.
      * As a concession to backwards compatibility, =0= re-initializes the sequence at all levels. This comes in handy when using a sequence within headers that are also used in a *%<nop>TOC%*. In that case, start the first heading using something like =---+ Chapter #<nop>#0. Introduction=. You can then safely use the number notation in headings.
   * The rendering of the numbering sequence can be turned into an letter-labeled list by appending a lowercase letter to the notation: =#<nop>#...a=

---+++ Numbered headings

   * When the =+= character in headings is replaced by =#=, the headings are numbered. Heading numbers are derived from the unnamed sequence and can, therefore, be affected by the syntax above.
      * Tip: Avoid unnamed sequences when using numbered headings.

---+++ General comments
   * Numbering count is maintained throughout a single topic. Included topics are considered part of the topic and are numbered in sequence with the including topic.
   * The maximum number of levels is 6, and using levels higher than maximum implies the last level.
   * Non-consecutive increasing levels generate =0= for the skipped levels.
   * Sequence numbering always starts at level 1. A missing first level will result in a =0= to indicate the skipped level.
   * Non-numbered headers do not affect the numbering of numbered headings.

Plugin settings are stored as preferences variables. To reference a plugin setting write ==%<nop>&lt;plugin&gt;_&lt;setting&gt;%==, i.e. ==%<nop>EXPLICITNUMBERINGPLUGIN_SHORTDESCRIPTION%==

   * One line description, is shown in the %SYSTEMWEB%.TextFormattingRules topic:
      * Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Use the ==#<nop>#.==, ==#<nop>#..== _etc._ notation to insert outline numbering sequences (1, 1.1, 2, 2.1) in topic's text. Support also numbered headings.
   * Debug plugin: (See output in =data/debug.txt=)
      * Set DEBUG = 0
