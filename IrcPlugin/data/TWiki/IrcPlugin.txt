---++ Further Development
   * queue/log with seperate program to spew messages as it can (and doesn't keep connecting and disconnecting)
   * when a topic is moved to the Trash, IrcPlugin reports ".../Trash/TopicName" was created rather than something more useful like (.../Web/TopicName was moved to Trash) - (read the Meta data for TOPICMOVED, iirc) - well, that's on notification when the topic is created, rather than removed...
