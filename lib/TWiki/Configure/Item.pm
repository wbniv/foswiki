#     Accept an attribute setting for this item (e.g. a key name).

# Purpose
#     Increase a numeric value, recursing up to a parentless item
# Assumptions
#     All item levels have $key defined and initialized
#     (intended for use with 'warnings' and 'errors')
#     Parents of items are items (or precisely: can inc())
