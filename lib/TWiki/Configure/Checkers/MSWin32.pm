This environment variable is used by Win32 Perls to run
commands from TWiki scripts - it determines which shell program is used to run
commands that use 'pipes'.  Examples of shell programs are cmd.exe,
command.com (aka 'DOS Prompt'), and Cygwin's 'bash'
(<strong>recommended</strong> if Cygwin is installed).
<p>
To use 'bash' with ActiveState or other Win32 Perl you should set the
PERL5SHELL environment variable to something like
<tt><strong>c:/YOURCYGWINDIR/bin/bash.exe -c</strong></tt>
This should be set in the System Environment, and ideally set directly in the
web server (e.g. using the Apache <tt>SetEnv</tt> directive).

    if ($isActivePerl) {
        $n .= $this->WARN(<<HERE);
ActiveState Perl on IIS does not support safe pipes, which is the mechanism used by TWiki to prevent a range
of attacks aimed at arbitrary command execution on the server. You are <b>highly</b> recommended not to use this
particular configuration on a public server (one exposed to the internet)
HERE
        if ( Win32::BuildNumber() < 631 ) {
            $n .= $this->WARN(<<HERE);
ActiveState Perl must be upgraded to at least build 631
if you are going to use PERL5SHELL, which was broken in earlier builds.
