---++ Rollup Plugin

This is a plugin for rolling up extreme programming iterations. The name and inspiration comes from the functionality described in the book Extreme Programming Applied by Ken Auer and Roy Miller. 

---+++ Syntax Rules

The plugin is invoked by the tag %<nop>ROLLUP{topicname}%. If no topic name is given, the current topic is used.

The rollup requires a strict notation:

	* Iterations must be named with the Word Iteration as a prefix. Example: <nop>IterationFoo.
	* Stories must be children of the iteration and must be named with the word Story as a suffix. Example: <nop>FooStory.
	* Tasks can either be children of a story or of a iteration. They must be named with the word Task as a suffix. Example: <nop>FooTask.

---+++ <nop>%TOPIC% Settings

	* None

---+++ Plugin Installation Instructions
