This package offers basic LDAP services for <nop>NextTwiki and offers authentication of
wiki users by binding to an LDAP server as well as incorporate LDAP user
groups into access control. 


Optionally, if you need an interface to query your LDAP directory and display
the results in a topic install the <nop>LdapNgPlugin
which will make use of the <nop>LdapContrib services. 
This work is a rewrite of the <nop>LdapPlugin by
Gerard Hickey while bringing authentication, user management and
other LDAP applications onto a common base.

This package downloads all relevant records from your LDAP server into a local cache the first
time you use it. This can take a noticeable period of time depending on the size of your LDAP database.
This cache will be refreshed on a configurable interval (defaults to once a day).
You can also disable automatic refreshing and refresh the <nop>LdapContrib's cache manually using
the "Refresh Cache" button below. Read the documentation of =MaxCacheAge= in the section
"Performance Settings" in <a href="%SCRIPTURLPATH{"configure"}%">configure</a>.

Tip: You can add this button on any page by adding
<verbatim>
%INCLUDE{"%SYSTEMWEB%.LdapContrib"}%
</verbatim>
to it.

---++ LDAP questionary
Before you can further configure the LDAP connection you will have to answer
a set of basic questions about your LDAP server. These are:

   1 What's the host name (or IP address) of the LDAP server (e.g. ldap.my.domain.com)?
   1 What port does it listen to LDAP requests (e.g. 389)?
   1 Does your LDAP Server use SASL to authenticate connections? If so which 
     authentication mechanism does it use (EXTERNAL, DIGEST-MD5, ...)?
   1 Do you have a kind of "proxy" user that the wiki can use to perform the initial connection?
     You need its DN and credentials. Advice: don't use the LDAP admin account, you
     only need a simple user that has read access to all of the directory (or the relevant
     parts); it does not need any write access.
   1 What is the "base dn" of the directory (e.g. =dc=my,dc=domain,dc=com= )?
   1 What is the common root/branch for all users? For example, Are they all found
     under =ou=people,dc=my,dc=domain,dc=com= or are they are
     scattered all over the place?
   1 What is the common root/branch where all groups are defined
     (e.g. ou=group,dc=my,dc=domain,dc=com)?
   1 What object class do user records have (e.g. =objectClass=organizationalPerson= )?
   1 What object class do group records have (e.g. =objectClass=group= )?
   1 Which attribute of a user record should be used to log in (must be unique)?
   1 Which attribute(s) of a user record do you want to use to construct a <nop>WikiName
     (used to display them online, pointing to their homepage)?
   1 What's the name attribute of a group?
   1 Which attribute in a group record defines its members (e.g. member or memberUid)?
     Note, that if the member attribute of a group is a DN you need to enable
     "member indirection" (see [[#Membership]]).

Collect the answers to these questions either yourself using your favorit LDAP
browser, or ask your friendly LDAP admin. 

---++ Authentication
To authenticate wiki users using your LDAP server 
you have to register the <nop>LdapPassword class as the so called
<nop>PasswordManager.  This is done by adding the following lines in the
=lib/LocalSite.cfg= configuration file (or by using the =configure= tool alternatively):
<verbatim>$TWiki::cfg{PasswordManager} = 'TWiki::Users::LdapPassword';</verbatim>

There is a further option to fallback to the normal authentication mechanism
by defining a secondary password manager. This allows you to create native wiki
accounts, e.g. a <nop>WikiAdmin account and authenticate him without LDAP.
Use the following setting to fallback to a htpasswd based authentication.
<verbatim>$TWiki::cfg{Ldap}{SecondaryPasswordManager} = 'TWiki::Users::HtPasswdUser';</verbatim>
So whenever authentication against LDAP fails, this second password manager will
be used. 

---++ User Groups
LDAP group records can be used in access control lists by registering a
<nop>UserMappingManager implementation. This is done by adding the following 
to your =lib/LocalSite.cfg= configuration file (or by using the =configure= tool alternatively):
<verbatim>$TWiki::cfg{UserMappingManager} = 'TWiki::Users::LdapUserMapping';</verbatim>

In addition you can decide if you want to _add_ the LDAP groups in additio or use
LDAP groups solely. This is controled by the <nop>WikiGroupsBackoff flag.  If
switched on then LDAP groups will be added. If there's a name clash LDAP groups
take precedence. If switched off <nop>WikiGroups are ignored.

You might decide in not using your LDAP groups but still map login names
to <nop>WikiNames. Both, LDAP user groups _and_ name mapping is done by the
<nop>UserMappingManager. So to make use of name mapping but _not_ its group
feature,
register the
<nop>LdapUserMapping implementation for the <nop>UserMappingManager but
disable the <nop>MapGroups setting.

---++ Membership
LDAP servers follow different schemata to define "membership". They store the
information either using a set of unique ids in
the group object (posixGroup) or the full DNs of the user objects
(groupOfNames). In the latter case the user objects' unique ids have to be
fetched separately based on their distinguished name. This mode has to be switched on 
using the =MemberIndirection= setting. 

The reverse relation, where the _user objects_ hold membership information
(for example using a =memberOf= attribute) is
maintained by some LDAP servers automatically. Those that encode membership this
way _only_ are not supported by the <nop>LdapContrib yet.

Furthermore, user objects may have one _primary_ group attribute.
This is a simple value that stores the id of a default group
that user is member of. This attribute is defined by specifying the =PrimaryGroupAttribute=
setting a.

<nop>LdapContrib reads membership information as they are stored
in the group objects, and may map the member object indirectly to the
login name. In addition any "primary group" setting stored in the user objects
is consulted as well.


---++ Normalization of login, wiki and group names
<nop>LdapContrib reads three kinds of names from your LDAP server and reuses this information
as needed. These are the login names - used to log in -,
the <nop>WikiNames - used to display users online -, and the group names - used in
access control lists.

The <nop>WikiName can be generated by 
setting the two parameters =WikiUserNameAttribute= and =NormalizeWikiName=.
=WikiUserNameAttribute= can be a comma separated list of LDAP attributes that are then
assembled to form the <nop>WikiName. If the =NormalizeWikiName= flag is set 
a couple of extra operations are performed to generate a proper <nop>WikiName, i.e.
removing illegal characters.
Given the setting
<verbatim>
$TWiki::cfg{Ldap}{WikiNameAttribute} = 'givenName,sn';
$TWiki::cfg{Ldap}{NormalizeWikiNames} = 1;
</verbatim>
The =givenName= and =sn= (surname) LDAP attributes will be fetched and concatenated
to form a <nop>WikiName, so that "givenName=Hans-Peter,sn=Leuthï¿½user-Schnarrenberg" will
result in the <nop>WikiName "<nop>HansPeterLeuthaeuserSchnarrenberg".
If one of the <nop>WikiNameAttributes is 'mail' the =@mydomain.com= part will be removed
all together.

The login name can be normalized by enabling the
<verbatim>$TWiki::cfg{Ldap}{NormalizeLoginNames} = 1;</verbatim>
setting. However the normalized result will not be forced to be a cammel case <nop>WikiName.

Similar to the <nop>WikiName of a user, group names can be normalized using
<verbatim>$TWiki::cfg{Ldap}{NormalizeGroupNames} = 1;</verbatim>

If a user in your LDAP directory changed his name, e.g. because of a mariage,
this use can be mapped to his/her old account using an alias that points back
from the old !WikiName to the new one. This is done using a setting like this:
<verbatim>$TWiki::cfg{Ldap}{WikiNameAliases} = 'MaryMalone=MaryForrester, ...'</verbatim>
The parameter takes a comma separated list of =FromWikiName=ToWikiName=. Whenever
this account is still used in an access control list, its rights will be
inheritted by the targeted =ToWikiName= account.


---++ SSO and <nop>LdapContrib
First of all, <nop>LdapContrib does not provide any SSO solution. Nor does LDAP
per se. However, LDAP directories might come with SSO facilities that they
provide via kerberos or similar. Unfortunately, nowaday browsers themselves are
not kerberized.  They depend on talking to the webserver using HTTP means,
which then decides which tickets are valid for the remote user by talking to
the acutal authority.  That is, authentication is implemented using an
approriate apache module.

<nop>LdapContrib can then be used to complete an LDAP integration by
providing the mapping to <nop>WikiNames as well as email information and group
definitions drawn from the LDAP directory directly.

The remaining problem is that, when a new user has been added to your LDAP
directory recently, and he/she then dashes off to sign on to the wiki right away,
<nop>LdapContrib's cache most probably is outdated. This situation is different
from one where users were authenticated by the build-in <nop>TemplateLogin
mechanism. The user would then not be able to login until the cache has been
refreshed manually or automatically.

So when the new user is authenticated using SSO and then hits the wiki, it might
fail to compute the proper <nop>WikiName. The solution to this problem is to
use the <nop>LdapApacheLogin login manager as a drop in replacement to the
standard <nop>ApacheLogin that would have been used in this situation. The
<nop>LdapApacheLogin will then take care that the remote user is known to the
cache and add this single record if it is missing.

Bottomline: whenever you are using apache to authenticate, do use the
<nop>LdapApacheLogin manager. Or in other words, whenever you configured the wiki
to use the standard <nop>ApacheLogin manager, and you now install
<nop>LdapContrib, change it to <nop>LdapApacheLogin to assure
<nop>LdapContrib's cache is up to date.


---++ Simple Example 
For the sake of this documentation we assume that users accounts in your
database are at leat of the type =posixAccount= and optionally also of type
=inetOrgPerson= storing email addresses. Moreover users are stored in a subtree
=ou=people= and groups are defined in =ou=group=. Here are some example LDAP
records:
<verbatim>
dn: uid=testuser1,ou=people,dc=my,dc=domain,dc=com
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
objectClass: posixAccount
cn: Test User1
uid: testuser1
uidNumber: 1024
gidNumber: 100
homeDirectory: /home/testuser1
loginShell: /bin/bash
mail: testuser1@my.domain.com

dn: uid=testuser2,ou=people,dc=my,dc=domain,dc=com
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
objectClass: posixAccount
cn: Test User2
uid: testuser2
uidNumber: 1024
gidNumber: 100
homeDirectory: /home/testuser2
loginShell: /bin/bash
mail: testuser2@my.domain.com
mail: testuser2@gmx.com

# users, Group, nats.informatik.uni-hamburg.de
dn: cn=users,ou=group,dc=my,dc=domain,dc=com
objectClass: posixGroup
cn: users
gidNumber: 100
memberUid: testuser1
memberUid: testuser2
</verbatim>

Please have a look at your LDAP manual on how to set up an LDAP server
and populate it with user account records. Have a look at the 
[[http://www.openldap.org/doc/admin23/quickstart.html][Quick-Start Guide]] on
how to install [[http://www.openldap.org/][OpenLdap]].

Use the following settings for the above example:
<verbatim>
$TWiki::cfg{Ldap}{Host} = 'ldap.my.domain.com';
$TWiki::cfg{Ldap}{Port} = 389; 
$TWiki::cfg{Ldap}{UserBase} = 'ou=people,dc=my,dc=domain,dc=com'; 
$TWiki::cfg{Ldap}{LoginFilter} = 'objectClass=posixAccount';
$TWiki::cfg{Ldap}{LoginAttribute} = 'uid';
$TWiki::cfg{Ldap}{WikiNameAttribute} = 'cn';
$TWiki::cfg{Ldap}{NormalizeWikiNames} = 1; 
$TWiki::cfg{Ldap}{GroupBase} = 'ou=group,dc=my,dc=domain,dc=com';
$TWiki::cfg{Ldap}{GroupFilter} = 'objectClass=posixGroup';
$TWiki::cfg{Ldap}{GroupAttribute} = 'cn';
$TWiki::cfg{Ldap}{MemberAttribute} = 'memberUid';
$TWiki::cfg{Ldap}{MemberIndirection} = 0;
$TWiki::cfg{Ldap}{MapGroups} = 1;
</verbatim>


---++ Configuration
The <nop>LdapContrib package is configured using a set of variables that need
to be added to the =lib/LocalSite.cfg= configuration file. 
Use the <a href="%SCRIPTURLPATH{"configure"}%">configure</a> tool (at least 
once) after you installed this package. Have a look at your =lib/LocalSite.cfg=
file afterwards. You might also make your changes therein directly to
accomodate your installation to your specifc LDAP installation and user
accounting. See the documentation within the =configure= tool for an explanation
of the various options.

---++ Updating the LDAP cache using a cronjob
In some environments, updating the internal LDAP cache of the <nop>LdapContrib might
take considerable time. The intervals the cache data is thought to be "expired" is
configured using the =MaxCacheAge= setting. This setting defaults to updating the
cache every 24 hours. The refresh procedure will then be triggered by the first request
that hits the site when this period expired. 

To remove this burden from the "first visitor in the morning", the automatic refresh procedure can
be disabled by setting 
<verbatim>$TWiki::cfg{Ldap}{MaxCacheAge} = 0; </verbatim>
This means that the age of the cached data will not be checked _automatically_ anymore. The 
responsibility that the data is updated is now up to you, that is you have to update the 
cache _explicitly_. This can be done by either hitting the red "Refresh Cache" button above,
or by setting up an appropriate cronjob on the machine running your wiki server.

To trigger an explicit update of the cache on 5 past midnight every day use a
cronjob similar to:
<verbatim>
5 0 * * * cd <wiki-install-path>/bin && ./view refreshldap=on Main/WebHome >/dev/null
</verbatim>
This will call the engine on the commandline and provide the necessary query parameters so
that the <nop>LdapContrib will force an update of the cache data.
