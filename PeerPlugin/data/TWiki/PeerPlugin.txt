_[please see Codev.PeerRatingSystem for development chit-chat]_

This plugin enables TWiki users to rate any topic for Quality of content and Relevance of the topic across their TWiki community. Several display methods are provided:

	* A star rating is inserted in the topic header
	* A Review link on each topic shows a list of the current reviews
	* A link on a user page shows a list of reviews made by that person
	* A ratings statistics topic shows an overall summary of reviews by topic

This plugin also allows members of the TWiki community to rate any web page - and can be used to focus attention on the best (and worst) pages out there.

Please note that this plugin uses a MySQL database for storage of review data. Installation help is provided in these topics (included in the install set):
