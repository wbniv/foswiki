---+!! Publish Web Plugin

Utility to publish a TWiki web to static HTML pages. Useful to maintain a static website collaboratively in an access restricted TWiki.

%TOC%

---++ Description and Syntax Rules

One web (defined in the PUBLISHWEBNAME setting) serves as the master for the static HTML pages. The Plugin generates an HTML page every time a user saves a topic in the Publish web. The static HTML files are based on a TWiki skin of choice. All referred attachments (images etc) are copied to a publish directory.

---+++ Topics and Links
	* The home topic is assumed to be =Index=
	* Topic names: For clarity, use capitalized words and underscores (%TWIKIWEB%.WikiWord names are possible too)
	* All links should be defined as double square bracket links, e.g. =[<nop>[Topic]]= or =[<nop>[Topic][label]]= (do not use %TWIKIWEB%.WikiWord links)

#PublishProcess
---+++ Publish process
<form action="%SCRIPTURL%/view%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%#PublishProcess">
	* A static HTML page is generated for exery topic saved in the %PUBLISHWEBNAME% web (unless listed in the EXCLUDETOPIC setting)
	* Topic names get converted to a lowercase filename, e.g. =Index= to =index.html=, =AboutUs= to =aboutus.html=, and =Customer_Support= to =customer_support.html=
	* Only text between =%<nop>STARTPUBLISH%= and =%<nop>STOPPUBLISH%= is used (the whole text if missing)
	* !WikiWord links are ignored, also across webs
	* Page layout is based on the skin defined in the PUBLISHSKIN setting
	* Topics can be re-published without an edit/save cycle.%BR%
	  Topic:
	  <select name="tname">
	  <option value="">select...</option>
	  <option>all</option>
	  %TOPICLIST{ web="%PUBLISHWEBNAME%" format="<option>$name</option>" separator=" " }% </select>
	  <input type="hidden" name="action" value="publish" />
	  <input type="submit" value="Publish" />
	  [[%SCRIPTURL%/view%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%#PublishProcess][Clear]]%BR%
	  %PUBLISHWEB{ "%URLPARAM{ "action" }%" topic="%URLPARAM{ "tname" }%" }%
</form>

---+++ Variables
	* =%<nop>STARTPUBLISH%= - place in topic text where to start publishing
		* Optional, start from top if missing
	* =%<nop>STOPPUBLISH%= - place in topic text where to stop publishing
		* Optional, publish to end of topic if missing
	* =%<nop>PUBLISHWEB{"nicetopic"}%= - nice topic name
		* Shows a "nice" topic name of the current topic: Underscores in topic names are rendered as space; the Index topic is rendered with the HOMELABEL Plugin setting
		* Example: Topic =Customer_Support= turns into =Customer Support=
	* =%<nop>PUBLISHWEB{"breadcrumb"}%= - nice breadcrumb
		* The breadcrumb is based on the parent child relationship of topics, starting at the Index topic
		* The breadcrumb does _not_ include the current topic, append =%<nop>PUBLISHWEB{"nicetopic"}%= to get the complete breadcrumb
		* The skin may contain a =%<nop>PUBLISHWEB{"breadcrumb"}%= variable to show the breadcrumb
		* Underscores in topic names are rendered as space
		* Example: =You are here: <u>Home</u> &gt; <u>Customer Support</u> &gt;=
	* =%<nop>PUBLISHWEB{"publish" topic="Name"}%= - re-publish topic(s) without edit/save cycle
		* Useful to refresh all HTML pages if the skin has been modified
		* A =topic="all"= publishes all topics in the Publish web except for the excluded ones
		* A =topic="Any_Topic"= publishes a specific topics

---++ Plugin Settings

Plugin settings are stored as preferences variables. To reference a plugin setting write ==%<nop>&lt;plugin&gt;_&lt;setting&gt;%==, i.e. ==%<nop>PUBLISHWEBPLUGIN_SHORTDESCRIPTION%==

	* One line description, is shown in the %TWIKIWEB%.TextFormattingRules topic:
		* Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Maintain a static website collaboratively in a TWiki web

	* Debug plugin: (See output in =data/debug.txt=)
		* Set DEBUG = 0

	* Web to publish:
		* Set PUBLISHWEBNAME = Publish

	* Skin to use to publish:
		* Set PUBLISHSKIN = print

	* Exclude topics from publishing:
		* Set EXCLUDETOPIC = WebPublish, WebChanges, WebHome, WebIndex, WebLeftBar, WebNotify, WebPreferences, WebRss, WebSearchAdvanced, WebSearch, WebStatistics, WebTopicList

	* Home label, used in =%<nop>PUBLISHBREADCRUMB%=:
		* Set HOMELABEL = Home

---++ Plugin Installation Instructions

__Note:__ You do not need to install anything on the browser to use this plugin. The following instructions are for the administrator who installs the plugin on the TWiki server. 

	* Download the ZIP file from the Plugin web (see below)
	* Unzip ==%TOPIC%.zip== in your twiki installation directory. Content:
	  | *File:* | *Description:* |
	  | ==data/TWiki/%TOPIC%.txt== | Plugin topic |
	  | ==data/TWiki/%TOPIC%.txt,v== | Plugin topic repository |
	  | ==data/Publish/WebPublish.txt== | Plugin topic |
	  | ==data/Publish/WebPublish.txt,v== | Plugin topic repository |
	  | ==lib/TWiki/Plugins/%TOPIC%.pm== | Plugin Perl module |
	* Configure and test the installated Plugin:
		* TWiki 4.0 and up: Run the [[%SCRIPTURL%/configure%SCRIPTSUFFIX%][configure]] script to enable the Plugin
		* Change the Plugin settings as needed (for now leave =PUBLISHSKIN = print= setting)
		* Configuration on shell level:
			* Settings in =lib/TWiki/Plugins/%TOPIC%.pm=: For security, the output directories are defined in the =%TOPIC%.pm= library. Change the hardcoded settings if needed:
				* =$publishPath= defines the output directory of the static HTML files, __relative to__ the =twiki/pub= directory; defaults to the parent directory of the =twiki/pub= directory; should point to the htdocs root directory
				* =$attachPath= defaults =_publish=; is __relative to__ =$publishPath=
			* Create the directory indicated in the =$attachPath= setting
			* Change the permission of directories indicated by =$publishPath= and =$attachPath= to be writable by the cgi user (typically user =nobody=)
		* Create new TWiki web for website publishing:
			* Create a new =Publish= web (name indicated by the =PUBLISHWEBNAME= Plugin setting)
			* In !WebPreferences of that web, set the =NOAUTOLINK= setting to =on=
			* For convenience, add these links to the WebLeftBar:
				* =*Publishing*=
				* =[<nop>[Index][Home page topic]]=
				* =[<nop>[http://%<nop>HTTP_HOST%/index.html][/index.html]]=
				* =[<nop>[http://%<nop>HTTP_HOST%%<nop>PUBLISHWEB{topicurl}%][%<nop>PUBLISHWEB{topicurl}%]]=
				* =[<nop>[%<nop>SCRIPTURL%/view%<nop>SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%<nop>WEB%/WebPublish?\%BR%action=publish;ptopic=%<nop>BASETOPIC%][Re-publish this topic]]=
				* =[<nop>[%<nop>TWIKIWEB%.PublishWebPlugin][PublishWebPlugin]]=
			* Create an =Test= topic in that web
			* This should generate an =test.html= page on topic save
			* Create =Index= topic and other topics
	* Publish skin:
		* Create a new publish skin based on your branding. The [[%TWIKIWEB%.TWikiSkins][TWiki skin]] can be derived from any =twiki/templates/view.*.tmpl= skin file
		* Omit any links to TWiki, such as edit and attach links
		* The skin can use Plugin specific settings =%<nop>PUBLISHWEB{"breadcrumb"}%= and =%<nop>PUBLISHWEB{"nicetopic"}%=
		* The skin can introduce skin specific [[Publish.WebPreferences]] settings, such as =%<nop>PUBLISH_SITE%=, =%<nop>PUBLISH_LOGO%=, etc.
		* Activate the new skin in the Plugin's =PUBLISHSKIN= setting

---++ Limitations

	* All attachments are copied into the same directory, e.g. make sure you use unique filenames across all topics in your publish web and in your skin
