Drupal
======

Installing Drupal
=================

http://drupal.org/drupal-5.7 (tested on 5.7 at the time of this writing)
http://drupal.org/getting-started/5/install

Installing Libraries
====================

Read the EXTERNALS file in jsdoc/lib

Installing the Module
=====================

http://drupal.org/node/70151
Drop the jsdoc folder into sites/all/modules

Enable the Module
=================

Enable in: Administer->Site building->Modules

Configure
=========

* Fill in the configuration in: Administer->Site configuration->JavaScript Documentation
** The file should be run from the docscripts directory
** The file used to parse code is dojo.inc (in the includes directory).
** Both should be full paths
** The base is "dojo"
* Copy one of the files in docscripts/modules (dojox.module is the best) if you want to
  support your project. Function names should begin with the module name.
  eg dojo.module's functions start with "dojo"

Run Cron
========

In the base of your Drupal folder, you'll see cron.php. Run this in the browser
