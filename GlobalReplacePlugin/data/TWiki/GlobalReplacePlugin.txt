%TOC%

---++ Plugin Settings

Plugin settings are stored as preferences variables. To reference a plugin setting write ==%<nop>&lt;plugin&gt;_&lt;setting&gt;%==, i.e. ==%<nop>GLOBALREPLACEPLUGIN_SHORTDESCRIPTION%==

	* One line description, is shown in the %SYSTEMWEB%.TextFormattingRules topic:
		* Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Global search and replace functionality across all topics in a web

	* Debug plugin: (See output in =data/debug.txt=)
		* Set DEBUG = 0

---++ Examples

---+++ Example 1: Changing a string

	1 Click Edit from a page
	1 Copy the string you want to change to the "Replace search string" field. This is the field you want to replace.
	1 Select web and a search string ( Sandbox, =TestTopic= ) 
	1 Replace any other non-numeric and non-alphabetic =[character]= with =[\character]=,  e.g. =[}]= with =[\}]=. This applies to "Replace search string" field only.
		* E.g. \%EDITCELL\{checkbox, 3, Input data exchange, ... \}\%
	1 Copy-paste the string to the "Replace string" field and modify it as you choose
	1 Press the "Search"-button and verify that the replaced and replacing strings are as expected
	1 Set all the checkboxes of the strings you want to replace. You can also select "Set all"
	1 Click "Replace all check-marked hits"

---+++ Example 2: Inserting a line _under_ another line
	1 Follow the previous example to the point where "Replace search string" is inserted
	1 Use =[(\n)]= in the "Replace search string", at the end of the line. This will be stored for use in the "Replace string". You can reference it by =[$x]=, where =[x]= is a number =1-9=.
		* E.g. We want to replace a line which _ends to_ a string =[Shutdown}% |]=. "Replace search string": =Shutdown\}\% \|(\n)= and "Replace string": =Shutdown}% |$1Something$1asdf$1=
	* *Note:* Using this trick you can also insert a line _before_ another line, by writing:
		* E.g. We want to insert a line before another line, which _begins with_ a string =[| *Keywords:* |]=. "Replace search string": =\| \*Keywords\:\* \|(.*?)(\n)= and "Replace string": =Something $2| *Keywords: |$1$2=
		* E.g. We want to replace a line which _begins with_ a string =[| *Keywords:* |]= and _ends with_ or _contains_ the string =[Interrupt}%]=. "Replace search string": =\| \*Keywords\:\* \|(.*?)Interrupt\}\%(.*?)(\n)= and "Replace string": =Something $3| *Keywords: |$1Interrupt}%$2$3=
