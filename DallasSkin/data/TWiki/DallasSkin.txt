This is the skin we primarily use at my company.  Nothing fancy, really.  Should work on any normal browser (IE, NS, Opera, etc.), but I haven't tested it on all of them yet.  The nice thing about this is that is is pretty fast.  The bad thing is that I have seen it do some wierd stuff.. the table formatting is really a hack job.  I just don't have the time to clean it up.  Maybe somebody wants to volunteer :)

The graphics suck (I'm not a professional at this ... I kinda hacked them from the old MikebSkin found on twiki.org (plus make a couple of new ones).

I also drew on a couple of tricks from OpenWiki and fixed up the fonts a little and set it up so that you can double click anywhere in the topic and start editing the page (whee!).

*Installation*

All you need to do is unzip the attached zip file from the twiki root, then replace the empty left and right logos with whatever you want.

Enjoy!
