This topic defines a table used in person and union topics when the
%SYSTEMWEB%.EditTablePlugin is installed.

The table is for arbitrary event records in a person's life, or a union,
that don't have standard fields in the form. For example, a person might
have records:

| *Record Type* | *Start* | *End* | *Description* |
| Occupation | 1877 | 1891 | Doctor of Pathology, University of Transylvania |
| Scandal    | 1891 | 1891 | Publicly accused of draculism |
| Emigration | 1892 | 1892 | Emigrated to Whitby, England |

or a union might have records:
| *Record Type* | *Start* | *End* | *Description* |
| Divorce       | 1947    | 1947  | Grandma discovers Grandpa's pet sheep |

Pick your own record types, or use standard record types such as those defined by the latter-day saints (LDS) record formats.

You can modify the following EDITTABLE statement to reflect your
requirements for this table.
%EDITTABLE{
   header="| *Record Type* | *Start* | *End* | *Description* |"
   format="| text, 40 | date | date | text, 80 |"
   changerows="on"
