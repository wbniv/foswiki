This topic defines a table format used in union topics when the
%TWIKIWEB%.EditTablePlugin is installed.

The table is for child records. These are simple one-column tables that
list the wikinames of the issue of the union. For example:
| *Child [[%TWIKIWEB%.WikiName][WikiName]]* |
| LesleyFitzwilliamIII |
| IanPeterNightly |

You can modify the following EDITTABLE statement to reflect your
requirements for this table, though you should always keep the first column or
you will break the searches used by the FamilyTreePlugin.

%EDITTABLE{header="| *Child [[%TWIKIWEB%.WikiName][WikiName]]* |" format="| text, 60 |" changerows="on"}%
