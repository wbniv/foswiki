---++ SingletonWikiWordPlugin

This designates that a single word is a reference to a single word. To show TWiki that it should be linked to, write a dot before it.

Hence if you have the WikiWord Ontology you can link to it as <nop>.Ontology

In fact, you can already force a single word link to a WikiWord by enclosing it in double square brackets, like this:
<nop>[<nop>[.Ontology]] 

This plugin allows you to write it without the square brackets. 

The syntax was chosen to be an extension of the Web.Topic syntax

Test:
| *Written as* | *Test* | *If it is installed properly you see* | *If it isn't, you will see* |
| .Singleword | .Singleword  | [[Singleword]] | <nop>.Singleword |
