%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

%TOC%

Improves the presentation of summaries for =keyword=, =word= and =literal= searches, by displaying topic content on either side of the search terms wherever they are found in the topic. Especially useful for searches in documentation.

For example, =%<nop>SEARCH{"cat +spasm" type="keyword"}%= produces:

<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/screenshot.gif" />

This plugin only works with TWiki-4 or later.

---++ Usage

Install and enable the plugin. It "just works". You can change the size of the context (the number of characters either side of a search term) by setting the [[%TWIKIWEB%.TWikiVariables][TWikiVariable]] =SEARCHSUMMARYPLUGIN_CONTEXT= (the default is 30). You can change the CSS class used to highlight search terms by setting =SEARCHSUMMARYPLUGIN_CSSCLASS=. The default is =twikiAlert=.

---++ Installation Instructions

---++ Some Technical Gobbledegook
This plugin uses a technique called [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch][monkey-patching]] where the plugin replaces a section of the core with some different code. It does this dynamically, so you can install the plugin without needing to change the core. However the monkey-patching technique is very sensitive to changes in the core code. If it stops working after an upgrade, and you have some programming knowledge, then check to make sure the core functions it patches still have the same prototype as in the previous release, and if not, fix the plugin.
