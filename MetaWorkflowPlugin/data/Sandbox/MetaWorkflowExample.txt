---+++ !MetaWorkflowPlugin Example

This is an example of how to use the TWiki.MetaWorkflowPlugin to create a workflow based on the value of a [[TWiki.TWikiForms][form field]].

This is what's displayed in the =%<nop>METAWORKFLOWCURRENT%=:%BR%
| %METAWORKFLOWCURRENT% | 
_Note: If you just see the plain variable, then the plugin is not enabled_

Below is the Meta Workflow Definition table. This defines what the value of the form field must be before the workflow can continue to the next row. The =FINAL= row defines the message which is to be displayed after the workflow has been completed.

The =%<nop>METAWORKFLOW{...}%= for this table is as follows:%BR%
=%<nop>METAWORKFLOW{type="FIELD" name="Status" key="value"}%=

%METAWORKFLOW{type="FIELD" name="Status" key="value"}%
| *Topic* | *Value* | *Message* |
| MetaWorkflowExamplePhaseOne | Complete | Currently in phase one |
| MetaWorkflowExamplePhaseTwo | Complete | Currently in phase two |
| MetaWorkflowExamplePhaseThree | Complete | Currently in phase three |
| FINAL | | Completed all phases |

This table could also have been stored in a separate topic, using the following setting (to use, you would need to remove the #):
   * #Set METAWORKFLOWDEFINITION = MetaWorkflowDefinitionTable
