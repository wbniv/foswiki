---++ Summary

This is a plugin for light-weight project tracking, in particular suited for XP projects. The original code was
written by TWiki:Main.RichardBennett, It was converted into this plugin by
TWiki:Main.MartinWatt and enhanced. This plugin was further extended by TWiki:Main.ThomasWeigert. It is now maintained as a branch of the original Foswiki:Extensions/XpTrackerPlugin. The focus of this branch was to support additional customizability of what is being tracked, as well as a low-overhead time tracking mechanism.

| %X% This is a branch of Foswiki:Extensions/XpTrackerPlugin supporting additional needs of our organization. Please consult the description of the original plugin to decide whether you will need these additional features. |

---++ Description

---+++ Layout

Projects are tracked in a hierarchy of information:

	* *Web* - the TWiki web for project tracking. One web can be used to track multiple products.
	* *Project* - A group of activities. Usually this will be major releases of a product. Each project has a page, which contains a generated summary of the project progress.
	* *Team* - A team is a group of developers that work on one or more groups of activities. Each team has a page which contains a generated summary of the team's progress.
	* *Iteration* - Work is divided into a series of short iterations. Each iteration has a page, the contents of which are also generated.
	* *Story* - An iteration comprises a number of stories. Stories are pieces of related functionality that are owned by a lead developer but can be worked on by more than one developer. The story page contains information on the acceptance criteria, and also a list of tasks.
	* *Tasks* - these are the atomic units of work. A story is usually broken up into a number of tasks. Tasks may be shared among more than one developer. Tasks details are entered on the story page.

Information is entered for Stories and their associated tasks, and for iteration dates. Information for all other levels in the hierarchy is generated.

Organizations typically decide on the hierarchy of their work items. While the terminology used above is that each _project_ is worked on by _teams_ which handle a set of _iterations_, others may prefer a structure where a _team_ works on a set of _projects_ consisting of _iterations_, or others.
The hierarchy is configurable via the =TEAMLABEL= and =PROJECTLABEL= variables. In this plugin, teams and projects are just organizational categories; their name can be configured by the above variables. Note, though, that the tags provided by this plugin follow the above order, so when configuring topics care has to be taken that no confusion results if an organization uses different terminology.

Example of hierarchy:

 | *Web*	|  *Team*		 |  *Project*  | *Iteration* | *Story* | *Tasks* |
 | Tracking |  <nop>CoreTeam  | <nop>BeijingRelease | <nop>BetterPerformanceIteration  | <nop>PatternSkinStory | <nop>Speed up loading of templates |

---+++ Usage

 Creation of pages is recursive, each page has an html form that uses a template to create child pages:
	* *Projects/Teams*. You can create a new team page using the html form on the home page for the tracking web. At each level of the hierarchy, additional lower level entities can be created. You can add additional content to these pages if desired, but do not delete the fields indicated below. This is used to provide high level overviews of schedule progress.
	* *Iterations* Create new iterations from the project pages.
	* *Stories* Create new stories from the iteration page. The story name can be any unique name, *as long as it ends with the string "Story"*. Fill in the two tables for the story summary and task list respectively.

The content of these topics are determined by templates, having the name of the entity postfixed with =Template=; there is usually a form attached, which is defined in the corresponding =Form=. You should configure these to your need, in particular, the forms and templates defining stories. Please take care to not delete the fields indicating to which entity in the hierarchy a topic belongs (e.g., in the =StoryForm=, the field =Iteration= tells us which iteration this story belongs to). Do not delete the state field for stories. When creating a new instance of an entity, there may be a choice of templates, which is determined by the corresponding =TemplateOptions= topic. 
 

---+++ %TOPIC% sample output

The iteration status page displays the stories and tasks currently allocated to that particular interation.

Stories are displayed in the order in which they are to be developed. Stories are completed when they are marked to be in the state configured to be the =STORYACCEPTEDINDICATION=.

Tasks within a story are displayed in the order in which they are to be developed. Tasks are considered complete once their estimate until completion is 0 days.

Below are examples of the generated tables produced by parsing the story pages:

---+++ Other tables available

This is a list of all the tables available. The names should be self-explanatory. Parameters are given in the form =param="value"=. The first parameter, if present, is also the default parameter, and its name can be omitted.

| *Variable*  | *Parameters*	| *Comment*	|
| XPSHOWALLPROJECTS	  | 	| |
| XPSHOWALLTEAMS		  |	| |
| XPSHOWALLITERATIONS	| 	| |
| XPSHOWPROJECTTEAMS	 | =project=	 | |
| XPSHOWPROJECTITERATIONS	| =project= | |
| XPSHOWPROJECTSTORIES  | =project=	 | |
| XPSHOWTEAMITERATIONS  | =team=	| Shows a table summarizing the iterations assigned to a team. |
| XPSHOWITERATION		 | =iteration=	 | Shows a table summarizing the iteration, listing each story with each task and its status. |
| XPSHOWITERATIONTERSE  | =iteration=	 | Shows a table summarizing the iteration. For each story, one line indicates the progress of this story. |
| XPSHOWPROJECTCOMPLETIONBYSTORIES  | =project=	| |
| XPSHOWPROJECTCOMPLETIONBYTASKS	 | =project=	| |
| XPPIVOTBYFIELD | =iteration=, =field=, =split=, =skip= | Creates a pivot table of all tasks in the iteration. =field= is the field in the task which serves as the pivot. The Boolean =split= indicates whether the field should be split into its components (useful only when this is the developer field and more than one developer are assigned to a task). The Boolean =skip= indicates whether to omitt ongoing tasks in the table.  |
| XPTEAMPIVOTBYFIELDREPORT | =team=, =field=, =split=, =skip= | Creates a pivot table of all tasks assigned to team. =field= is the field in the task which serves as the pivot. The Boolean =split= indicates whether the field should be split into its components (useful only when this is the developer field and more than one developer are assigned to a task). The Boolean =skip= indicates whether to omitt ongoing tasks in the table.  |
| XPCREATETOPIC | =Team= / =Project= / =Iteration= / =Story= (default: =Story=), =Prompt= | Creates a form that will construct a new topic of the indicated kind, the prompt is a heading preceding the form (a heading level could be indicated by putting it into the prompt). |

%X% Remember that the actual display of the hierarchy of activities can be configured by settings and may differ from the terminology reflected by these tags.

---++ Time Tracking

Developers often work on more than one task at a time. We do want developers to keep their information up to date, which becomes tediuos if a developer works on many tasks. The following two tags simply this effort:

| *Variable*  | *Parameters*	| *Comment*	|
| XPSHOWDEVELOPERTIMESHEET | =who= | Shows a table of all tasks that are assigned to the given developer. |
| XPSHOWDEVELOPERESTIMATE | =who= | Shows a table of all tasks that are assigned to the given developer for which the developer has not yet given an estimate (i.e., the estimated effort and effort to do fields are blank or contain a question mark). |
| XPSHOWLOAD | =project=, =who= | Shows the work load by developer and iteration for the selected project. If =who="all"= or omitted, shows the work load for all developers. If =project= is omitted, shows all projects. |

Below the estimate or timesheet table is a button that puts the table into edit mode and allows the user to enter estimates or update the information about effort spent for all open tasks at once.

Updates to the tasks as well as estimates can be given either in hours or days, as the user selects (however, the units must be consistent for the table). In addition, the user can select to have a report generated of the results of the update (this is helpful in case some of the topics are locked by some other user and could not be updated; also, such report gives the user a record of the information entered).

When updating assigned tasks the user can update the units spent on a task or the units remaining on the task or both. For updating the effort remaining, the user can select to do so in units of effort, or in percent done. For ongoing tasks (i.e., tasks that do not have a defined finish, only the effort spent can be updated.

When updating estimates, the user can provide an estimate of the effort to be performed on a task.

After filling in the desired information, the user must click the button below the table to submit the information to be added to the appropriate tasks. If the generate report options was selected, the report is presented.

---++ Getting Started with !XpTracking

The distribution contains a set of template files in directory =data/_default_XpTracker=. The initial setup of a tracking web might be easiest if one starts from that example. Begin with !GettingStarted.

When designing your own templates and tracking topics, there are a few rules that must be followed, lest the application will not work. (In the following, TEAMLABEL stands for what was configured to be the hierarchy for "Team", and PROJECTLABEL for "Project".)
   * While templates instantiating the tracking topics may have any name, they must have attached the following forms:
      * Stories: !StoryForm
      * Iterations: !IterationForm
      * TEAMLABEL: !TEAMLABELForm
   * You can use arbitrary fields in forms defining the tracking topics, but the following fields must be present, as they are internally used:
      * Stories: Iteration, Submit Date, State, Story Summary
      * Iterations: !TEAMLABEL, Start, End, Actual, Summary
      * TEAMLABEL: !PROJECTLABEL
   * The templates that can be chosen to instantiate tracking topics must be listed in the following topics:
      * Stories: !StoryTemplateOptions
      * Iterations: !IterationTemplateOptions
      * TEAMLABEL: !TEAMLABELTemplateOptions
      * PROJECTLABEL: !PROJECTLABELTemplateOptions

Due to a defect in Twiki 4.0 (fixed in TWiki 4.1) please copy the preference settings in the "<nop>XpTrackerPlugin" section of the !WebPreferences sample topic into your the !WebPrefernces topic of the tracking web.

To illustrate the customization of the work breakdown structure, in the sample tracking web the hierarchy of work is configured differently from the default.
