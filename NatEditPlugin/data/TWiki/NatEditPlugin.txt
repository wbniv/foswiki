---++ Description
The <nop>NatEdit is an wiki editor that helps in learning the TML
Language by providing a GUI. By design, this is not a wysiwyg editor that tries
to generate the correct TML in the background. Instead, the user is still in
charge of writing correct wiki markup but with a bit more of assistance as a
plain browser textarea. Therefor this editor helps to lower the learning curve
but will not get in your way once you are aware of wiki markup. 

<nop>NatEdit is implemented as a jquery plugin, called =jquery.natedit=,
and thus heavily depends on javascript. Hence browsers without javascript are not supported. 
You will need to install the TWiki:Plugins/JQueryPlugin to use <nop>NatEdit.

Caution:
Unlikely previous versions (pre 2.0), 
theming has been disabled in the current version. So you are "stuck" with one and the
same button layout for now.

---++ Configuration
*PatternSkin:* %BR%
To enable the <nop>NatEditPlugin add the identifier =natedit= to the =SKIN= 
variable in %USERSWEB%.SitePreferences or WebPreferences, e.g.
<pre>
   * <!-- -->Set SKIN = natedit,pattern
</pre>

*NatSkin:* %BR%
No extra configuration steps are needed in case you are using TWiki:Plugins/NatSkin.
<nop>NatEditPlugin is the default editor for <nop>NatSkin, that is the normal
<pre>
   * <!-- -->Set SKIN = nat
</pre>
is sufficient.

   * Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = A Wikiwyg Editor
-->

---++ <nop>JSUnitContrib based Unit tests
There is a small set of browser based unit tests defined in
NatEditPluginJSUnitTests that can be run as a problem diagnosing tool. These
require the installation of TWiki:Plugins.JSUnitContrib, and then can be run
from
*[[%PUBURL%/%SYSTEMWEB%/JSUnitContrib/testRunner.html?testpage=%SCRIPTURL{"view"}%/%WEB%/NatEditPluginJSUnitTests][Run all tests]]*

Testing has been carried out using Safari, Firefox, Opera and Internet Explorer.
