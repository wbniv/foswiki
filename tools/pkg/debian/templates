 TWiki includes a complete "starter kit" which includes user
 registration pages, documentation, and tutorials.  Only decline if
 you're re-installing TWiki after deleting the package and want to
 keep the old data, or if you've got a TWiki data set from your own
 manual install.  If data/Main/WebHome.txt is present, the starter kit
 will not be unpacked.  The starter kit files can be found in
 /usr/share/twiki/twiki-data.tar.gz (and twiki-pub.tar.gz), if you
 want to install it manually or compare your topics with the new
 version.
