# The TWiki 'bin' directory must be on your include path when you run
# this script. This is so it can pick up the right TWiki environment
# from setlib.cfg.
# You can add a directory to your include path using the -I option
# to the perl command e.g. perl -I /usr/local/twiki/bin tick_twiki.pl
#
# It executes a number of non-essential regular administration
# tasks that will help keep your TWiki healthy and happy.
#
# It is intended to be run as a cron job (remember it has to be run
# by a user who can write files created by the webserver user!)
# For example,
#
# 0 0 * * 0 cd /usr/twiki/bin && perl ../tools/tick_twiki.pl
