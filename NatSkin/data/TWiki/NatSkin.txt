NatSkin offers a decent appearance that increases
usability and customizability in several respects to quickly accomplish a
personalized wiki experience.

NatSkin allows you to switch between several kinds of page layouts. All of the
predefined themes come with support for a 1,2 and 3 columns designs.
To get a first impression check out the NatSkinStyleBrowser:
   * select one of the predefined styles
   * alter the header art by selecting a style variation
   * flip the sidebar from the left to the right
   * select different page framing by switching on/off page borders or
     enable a thin blog-like layout
   * switch on/off navigations tabs above the main area, the so called <nop>WebButtons
   * the position of the search box can be set to one of four predefined positions

---++ Acknowledgement
This is a rework of the 
TWiki:Plugins/CopyCatSkin by TWiki:Main/MattWilkie. It is used at the 
[[http://nats-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/Main/WebHome][Natural Language Systems Division]] 
(NATS) of the University of Hamburg, Germany. 

The NatSkinPlugin is inspired by the TWiki:Plugins/GnuSkin by
TWiki:Main/JoachimNilsson. The TWiki:Plugins/PhotonSkin by
TWiki:Main/EstebanManchado (<nop>PhotonSearch) renamed to =natsearch= .

---++ Feature Overview
*Conditional markup and skin states:* 

The NatSkinPlugin maintaines an internal representation of different ways to
render the NatSkin concerning
   * the skin style,
   * style variants,
   * the sidebar location,
   * the page border decoration,
   * the web buttons in the topbar and
   * the positioning of the search box
and provides the infrastructure to get, set and display the skin style that
is currently active as well as rendering different content depending on the skin state.
This, for example, allows to switch the sidebar navigation from the left
to the right with a single click.

*Componentized templates:*

The underlying templates that generate the TWiki pages are arranged in a flexible and
manageable way to facilitate easy "skin mix-in", that is overriding specific parts of
the templates by using the NatSkin as a base skin to create template modifications.

*Customizing webs using <nop>WebComponents:*

   * <nop>WebSideBar: a configurable navigation bar
   * <nop>WebLinks: component used by the standard navigation scheme to plug in more
     navigation links
   * <nop>WebButtons: navigation tabs above the topic area
   * <nop>MySideBar: every user can extend the sidebar with a personalized navigation
   * <nop>WebHtmlHead: additional stuff to be put into the html head
   * <nop>WebJavaScript: additional javascript code per web
   * <nop>WebTopicActions: actions to manipulate TWiki topics
   * <nop>WebMoreTopicActions: actions when clicking on "More"

*Search &amp; GO* 

NatSearch: a search+go box that combines advanced search with the GO feature of TWiki.
Compared to the standard WebSearch <nop>NatSearch is trying to maximize usability
and minimizing workflow disruption. In addition, <nop>NatSearch can be customized
on an application level to specify the scope of search (using include/exclude rules)
as well as the appearance of listed search hits.

*Wikiwyg editor:* 

javascript enabled wikiwyg editor

*Email Obfuscation:* 

Optionally, all email addresses can be obfuscated by use of javascript. Email
links are still clickable while automatic email extraction is hampert.

*External link detection:*

All offsite links are marked and a nice icon is added. Clicking on them will
allways open an extra window.
