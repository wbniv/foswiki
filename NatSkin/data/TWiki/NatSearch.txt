Search facility for the NatSkin.

%TOC%

---++ Description
<nop>NatSearch unifies the Search and the Jump box known from the standard TWiki. It 
uses one input field to either jump to a topic or perform a query. You can even
use it as a quick way to create and edit new topic by entering =e:NewTopic= into the input field.

<nop>NatSearch is heavily inspired by the <nop>PhotonSearch of the TWiki:Plugins/PhotonSkin.

---++ Usage
<nop>NatSearch basically works in three modes that are distinguished depending of the input to
the search formfield:
   1 if your input starts with an uppercase letter, <nop>NatSearch tries to find the named topic and jumps to it;
     you may enter the target topic using the =web.topic= notation
   2 if your input starts with an uppercase letter but does not exist as a topic, a topic search tries
     to find it; if there is exactly one search hit, <nop>NatSearch jumps to it directly
   3 in any other case a combined topic+content search is conducted and its result is displayed in a table,
     sorted by modification time, descending

---++ Options
The search string may be prepended with a set of options that are separated from the
rest of the search string with a colon(:). Known options are:
| *Option* | *Description* |
| e(dit) | edit the named topic; note, that this does not perform any search operation |
| n(new) | same as =e= but create a new topic, the named topic must not exist |
| g | global search (default is local) |
| l | local search |
| k | do a keyword match |

A search string may consist of a list of terms that are retrieved. If a term shall contain
spaces it can be surrounded by double quotes. Each term may be preceded with a minus (-) to
exclude this term from the hit set.

---++ Examples
| *Search* | *Description* |
| <nop>TWikiUsers | if the current web is the %MAINWEB% go to the <nop>TWikiUsers  |
|                 | if the current web is the %SYSTEMWEB% go to the <nop>UsersGuide |
| g:twikiusers | list all topics in all webs whose name match "twikiusers" |
| g:copyright -webpref | list all topics that contain the word "copyright" but not "webpref" |
| g:"Good morning" -natskin | list all topics that contain the term "Good morning" but not "natskin" |
| e:Sandbox.TestTopic411 | edit <nop>Sandbox.TestTopic411 |
| TWiki.graphics | search for "graphics" in the TWiki web |


---++ Configuration
<nop>NatSearch can be restricted to certain webs and topics by setting WebPreferences.
Besides the NOSEARCHALL feature of every web that excludes a web from search the following variables
 restrict the hit set:

| *Name* | *Description* |
| =NATSEARCHINCLUDEWEB= | a regular expression that must match webs to be considered |
| =NATSEARCHEXCLUDEWEB= | a regular expression that must not match a web |
| =NATSEARCHINCLUDETOPIC= | a regular expression that must match a topic in the hit set |
| =NATSEARCHEXCLUDETOPIC= | a regular expression that excludes a topic from the hit set |
| =NATSEARCHGLOBAL= | 'on' searches in all public webs, \
  'off' restricts search to the current web (default), \
  same as the =g= option |
| =NATSEARCHKEYWORDS= | 'on' searches for full words only, \
  ' off' tries to match substrings also (default) |
| =NATSEARCHLIMIT= | limits the number of topics to show, defaults to all |
| =NATSEARCHIGNORECASE= | 'on' or 'off', the default is case insensitive |
| =NATSEARCHTEMPLATE= | configure application-specific search templates topic |

The WebPreferences variable =NATSEARCHTEMPLATE= can be set to a template topic that
is used instead of the skin's =search= template. This can be used in <nop>TWikiApplications to
define a customized look of search results.
