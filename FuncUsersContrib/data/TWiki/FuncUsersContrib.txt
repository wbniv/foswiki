|  Version: | %$VERSION%  |
|  Change History: | |
|  10558 | Now supports ACL stored in META:PREFERENCE |
|  9060 | Removed NOSEARCHALL handling from setACLs |
|  9046 | Was not deleting the old setting out of the file, just writing the new setting at the end. Not a killer, just untidy. |
|  8877 | TWikibug:Item1701 - getting install right |
|  8856 | TWikibug:Item1682 - Further improvements to the user access, include access to ACL lists (read and write) |
|  8847 | TWikibug:Item1670 - didn't realise getAllGroups wasn't in TWiki4 |
|  8837 | TWikibug:Item1670 - proof-of-concept demonstrator for functions for user data access from plugins, long overdue. |
