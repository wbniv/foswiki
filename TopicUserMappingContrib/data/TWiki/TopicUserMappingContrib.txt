%TOC%

The _User Mapping Manager_ interface provides services for mapping between a 'user identity' as used when talking to an external authentication provider,
an internal TWiki canonical user ID, and the displayed name used to identify the user in TWiki. 
This is the default <nop>TopicUserMapping in which user information is stored in TWiki topics - one per user, and then any mapping needed is done using the
<nop>WikiUsers topic in the %MAINWEB%.

see [[http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/SimplifiedUserMappingCodeInterface][SimplifiedUserMappingCodeInterface]] on TWiki.org for a more detailed discussion
of the concepts.
