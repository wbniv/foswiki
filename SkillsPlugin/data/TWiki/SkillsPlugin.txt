This plugin allows users to specify what skills they have and their level of proficiency. The user can then display their skills on their home page, and view other users skills by browsing through specific categories/skills.

%TOC%

---++ Example

Below is a screenshot of the users skill being displayed on their homepage. Click for the full image.

<a href="%ATTACHURLPATH%/skills_screenshot_full.png"><img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/skills_screenshot_thumb.png" alt="skills_screenshot_thumb.png" /></a>

To get the skills displayed on the users home page, as in this example, look at SkillsDisplayOnHomePage.

---++ User Interface

---+++ Users

The user interface for general users can be found at the following places:

   * SkillsBrowseAll
   * SkillsEditMySkills
   * SkillsSearch

---+++ Managing Categories and Skills

To create, modify or delete categories/skills, follow the instructions at SkillsAdminIntroduction.

---+++ Advanced Search

You can create a more advanced search, by creating the form yourself and using an extra input field. This can allow searching for users in a particular office/location. This is described in detail at SkillsAdvancedSearch.
