---++ Games rules.

The game is simple. You create a TWiki topic with one or more lines with the TWiki variable %<nop>MEETINGBINGO%.

The plugin then makes a table 5 rows by 5 columns with 25 of the MEETINGBINGOWORDS in a completely random order.

Each participant prints out the topic on paper. Use the print view mode. Each time you refresh the page you get a new bingo card so you can produce many quite quickly. You can have more than one on each page. You can also bring a laptop to the meeting and pretend to read emails.

During the meeting the participants listen carefully to what is said by the other participants. Each time a word is spoken that you have on your bingo card you mark it with a pen. If you have a computer available you can mark the words yellow by clicking on the table cell. When you have 5 in the same row, or 5 in the same column, or 5 on the diagonal, the person stands up and shout "Bingo!" and we have a winner.

You can continue the game for two rows, or the entire card if you so wish and if the meeting is long enough.

---++ Variations

The name of this game was originally Bullshit Bingo. But to not provoke too much when managers see the list of installed plug-ins this plug-in has a more appropriate business name.

The original rule is that the winner stands up and shout "Bullshit". If your manager or worse your CEO is in the meeting it may be a good idea that either he is also participating or you use an alternative winner word like "Hear Hear!" or "Bravo!" or "Banana!".

---++ Syntax Rules

   * %<nop>MEETINGBINGO% - creates a bingo card
   * %<nop>MEETINGBINGOWORDS - are the words for bingo. Minimum 25 words comma separated
   
---++ Settings

The plug-in has one setting. You need to give it minimum 25 words of the kind that people have a tendency to "over-use" at meetings. They are typically business trend words.

The plug-in ships with a default list. You can add your own additional words. A word can be 2-3 words with spaces between. It is the comma that separates them from each other.
