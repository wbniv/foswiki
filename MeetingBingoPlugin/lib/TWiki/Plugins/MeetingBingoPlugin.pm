---+ package MeetingBingoPlugin

__NOTE:__ When writing handlers, keep in mind that these may be invoked
on included topics. For example, if a plugin generates links to the current
topic, these need to be generated before the afterCommonTagsHandler is run,
as at that point in the rendering loop we have lost the information that we
the text had been included from another topic.

# This should always be $Rev: 12445$ so that TWiki can determine the checked-in
# status of the plugin. It is used by the build automation tools, so

$VERSION = '$Rev: 12445$';

# This is a free-form string you can use to "name" your own plugin version.
# It is *not* used by the build automation tools, but is reported as part
# of the version number in PLUGINDESCRIPTIONS.
$RELEASE = '1.1';

# Short description of this plugin
# One line description, is shown in the %SYSTEMWEB%.TextFormattingRules topic:
$SHORTDESCRIPTION = 'Meeting Bingo Plugin is a business game to enhance attention at meetings.';

# You must set $NO_PREFS_IN_TOPIC to 0 if you want your plugin to use preferences
# stored in the plugin topic. This default is required for compatibility with
# older plugins, but imposes a significant performance penalty, and
# is not recommended. Instead, use $TWiki::cfg entries set in LocalSite.cfg, or
# if you want the users to be able to change settings, then use standard TWiki
# preferences that can be defined in your Main.TWikiPreferences and overridden
# at the web and topic level.
$NO_PREFS_IN_TOPIC = 0;

# Name of this Plugin, only used in this module

---++ initPlugin($topic, $web, $user, $installWeb) -> $boolean
   * =$topic= - the name of the topic in the current CGI query
   * =$web= - the name of the web in the current CGI query
   * =$user= - the login name of the user
   * =$installWeb= - the name of the web the plugin is installed in

REQUIRED

Called to initialise the plugin. If everything is OK, should return
a non-zero value. On non-fatal failure, should write a message
using TWiki::Func::writeWarning and return 0. In this case
%FAILEDPLUGINS% will indicate which plugins failed.

In the case of a catastrophic failure that will prevent the whole
installation from working safely, this handler may use 'die', which
will be trapped and reported in the browser.

You may also call =TWiki::Func::registerTagHandler= here to register
a function to handle variables that have standard TWiki syntax - for example,
=%MYTAG{"my param" myarg="My Arg"}%. You can also override internal
TWiki variable handling functions this way, though this practice is unsupported
and highly dangerous!

__Note:__ Please align variables names with the Plugin name, e.g. if 
your Plugin is called FooBarPlugin, name variables FOOBAR and/or 
FOOBARSOMETHING. This avoids namespace issues.
