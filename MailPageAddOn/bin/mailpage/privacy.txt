<b><i>Why do I have to submit my email address??</i></b><br>
This is because we have to sent an email to your friend, and when you supply your email address, and your friend wants to reply to the email which includes the page, the reply comes to you, and not to us.<p>
We do not store any email address, and your email address will simply be gone after the program has finished the procedure, and you see the final page.<br>
We do store your email address in a cookie on your computer. If you ever use the service again, we'll "know" your email address and name, and you don't have to fill out those lines anymore.<p>
