---+!! Black List Plugin

%TOC%

---++ Description

This is a simple utility to keep black sheep away from a public TWiki site. The site can be protected against excessive page access (e.g. by bad robots), suspicious activities of users, such as multiple registrations or rapid topic updates indicating Wiki:WikiSpam, or saving text with wiki-spam.

The Plugin monitors activities by IP address and uses three IP address lists to protect the TWiki site:
	* WHITELIST: Manually maintained list of users who should never get on the BANLIST
	* BLACKLIST: Manually maintained list of malicious users
	* BANLIST: Automatically updated list of users with suspicious activities

On topic save, text is compared to a known list of spam patterns. If wiki-spam is identified, topic save is cancelled, an error message is shown, and the IP address is put on the BANLIST. Two wiki-spam lists are used:
	* Local SPAMLIST: Manually maintained list of spam patterns
	* Public wiki-spam list: Big list of wiki-spam patterns, retrieved from external web site

Users on the BLACKLIST and BANLIST will have every page access delayed by one minute and will get an error message.

The registration form can also be protected from improper use.

To fight Wiki-spam, the Plugin can also add a =rel="nofollow"= parameter to external URLs. Search engines will not follow links that have this parameter, taking away the incentive to add spam to TWiki.

#SpamList
<form name="spamlist" action="%SCRIPTURL%/viewauth%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%#SpamList" method="post">
	* Local SPAMLIST: Manually maintained list of spam patterns (NOTE: *Must be* %SYSTEMWEB%.RegularExpression patterns)
		* Action: <select name="spam_action"> <option></option> <option value="spam_add">Add</option> <option value="spam_remove">Remove</option> </select> wiki-spam regex pattern(s) <code>http://.*?</code><input type="text" name="spam" size="32" value="" /> <input type="submit" value="Submit" /> %BLACKLISTPLUGIN{ action="%URLPARAM{spam_action}%" value="%URLPARAM{spam}%" }%
		* Current list: %BLACKLISTPLUGIN{ action="spam_show" }%
</form>

#ExcludeList
<form name="spamlist" action="%SCRIPTURL%/viewauth%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%#ExcludeList" method="post">
	* EXCLUDELIST: Manually maintained list of exceptions to public wiki-spam patterns, useful to exclude patterns listed incorrectly as spam (NOTE: *Must be* %SYSTEMWEB%.RegularExpression patterns)
		* Action: <select name="exclude_action"> <option></option> <option value="exclude_add">Add</option> <option value="exclude_remove">Remove</option> </select> exclude spam regex pattern(s) <code>http://.*?</code><input type="text" name="spam" size="32" value="" /> <input type="submit" value="Submit" /> %BLACKLISTPLUGIN{ action="%URLPARAM{exclude_action}%" value="%URLPARAM{spam}%" }%
		* Current list: %BLACKLISTPLUGIN{ action="exclude_show" }%
</form>

	* Public wiki-spam list: Big list of wiki-spam patterns, retrieved from external web site (thanks to <nop>MoinMoin's [[http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/AntiSpamGlobalSolution][AntiSpamGlobalSolution]] wiki-spam list)
		* Set SPAMLISTURL = http://arch.thinkmo.de/cgi-bin/spam-merge

	* Cache refresh time (in minutes) for public wiki-merge pattern list:
		* Set SPAMLISTREFRESH = 60

	* Cache refresh time (in minutes) for internal wiki-spam regular expression cache:
		* Set SPAMREGEXREFRESH = 10

	* Message for users trying to save text with wiki-spam:
		* Set WIKISPAMMESSAGE = Wiki-spam detected: "%WIKISPAMWORD%" is a banned word and cannot be saved. Your IP address %REMOTE_ADDR% is black listed at the %WIKITOOLNAME% web site due to suspicious activities. Please contact site administrator %WIKIWEBMASTER% if you got on the list by mistake.

---+++ Registration protection settings
	* Protect registration: (number of minutes to expire, 15 minutes is recommended, 0 to disable)
		* Set REGEXPIRE = 0
		* If enabled, a magic number is protecting the registration process. TWiki expects a form field with a magic number. An error message is shown if not valid or if expired. This makes it harder to register a user by a script. A hidden field needs to be added to the registration form:%BR% =&lt;input type="hidden" name="rx" value="%<nop>BLACKLISTPLUGIN{ action="magic" }%" /&gt;=

	* Message shown when using registration form incorrectly: (this message is deliberately vague)
		* Set REGMESSAGE = Registration failed, please try again.

---+++ Nofollow link setting
	* Add a =rel="nofollow"= parameter to external URLs. Use this is to fight Wiki-spam. Search engines will not follow the link if a URL has a nofollow parameter, such as =&lt;a href="http://spammer.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;=. Specify topic age in hours for which the nofollow parameter should appear (set it to a value that gives you enough time to remove spam); set it to -1 to add the nofollow parameter unconditionally to external URLs; or 0 to disable: (-1, 0, 1...N)
		* Set NOFOLLOWAGE = -1

---++ Plugin Installation Instructions

__Note:__ You do not need to install anything on the browser to use this plugin. The following instructions are for the administrator who installs the plugin on the server where TWiki is running. 

	* Download the ZIP file from the Plugin web (see below)
	* Unzip ==%TOPIC%.zip== in your twiki installation directory. Content:
	  | *File:* | *Description:* |
	  | ==data/TWiki/%TOPIC%.txt== | Plugin topic |
	  | ==data/TWiki/%TOPIC%.txt,v== | Plugin topic repository |
	  | ==lib/TWiki/Plugins/%TOPIC%.pm== | Plugin Perl module |
	  | ==pub/TWiki/%TOPIC%/.htaccess== | Apache access control to protect pub dir |
	  | ==templates/oopsblacklist.tmpl== | Generic oops message |
	* Make sure =pub/TWiki/%TOPIC%/= is writable by the CGI user (typically =nobody=)
	* Add the hidden form field to the registration form as described in the "Registration protection settings" section (this is already in TWiki 4.0)
	* From TWiki 4.0 release on: Run the configure utility in your browser to enable the Plugin
	* Make sure that non-administrators cannot edit this plugin topic. By default, this topic is write protected with an =ALLOWTOPICCHANGE = !TWikiAdminGroup= setting.
	* Test if the installation was successful:
		1 Using above form, add the IP address of one of your workstations to the BANLIST
		1 Access TWiki from that workstation
			* if you look at a TWiki topic (with the view script) you should see the BLACKLISTMESSAGE (defined above) after a one minute timeout
			* else, you should get an 500 Internal Server Error for other scripts
		1 On a different workstation, remove the IP address of the test workstation from the BANLIST

---++ Known Issues and Limitations

	* Wiki-spam filtering for HTML attachments works in TWiki 01-Sep-2004 and later.
	* With TWiki 4.0.2 on some platforms, notably Solaris, attached files are uploaded with a zero file size. This is because there is a bug in how TWiki 4.0.2 handles the beforeAttachmentSaveHandler. If affected, upgrade TWiki or apply bug fix [[TWikibug:Item2390][Item2390]]
	* Scan for script eval() and escape() is currently hardcoded
