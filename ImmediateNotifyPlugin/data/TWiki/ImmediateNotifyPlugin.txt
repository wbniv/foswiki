---+ Immediate Notify Plugin

%RED%Please read Foswiki:Extensions.MailerContrib%ENDCOLOR%.

This is a plugin that allows users to be immediately notified when topics or webs are modified.

---++ Syntax Rules

Once the plugin is installed, users can register for notification in the Web<nop>ImmediateNotify topics by including their username as an entry in a list.  In order to recieve notifications, they must also configure their desired notification method.  Since SMTP and Jabber are currently the only available methods, this consists of:
   * Adding a line ="      * Set IMMEDIATENOTIFYMETHOD = Jabber"= (or "SMTP", respectively) to their topic.
   * Adding a line ="Jabber: jabber_user@jabber_server.org"= to their topic for notification per Jabber (no configuration is needed for SMTP).

---++ <nop>%TOPIC% Global Settings

   * One line description, shown in the %SYSTEMWEB%.TextFormattingRules topic:
      * Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Allows immediate notification of topic changes through SMTP or Jabber

   * Notification method configuration:
      * Set METHODS = SMTP
   * Jabber method configuration:
      * Set JABBER_USERNAME = 
      * Set JABBER_PASSWORD = 
      * Set JABBER_SERVER = 

   * Debug plugin: (See output in =data/debug.txt=)
      * Set DEBUG = 0
