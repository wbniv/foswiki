---+!! %TOPIC%

This plugin is inspired by the <nop>WordPress <nop>TimeSince plugin.
It which can be used to display a time difference in a human readable way, for instance to tell you that a topic has been published "2 days, 3 hours ago".

There are some problems with the original [[http://binarybonsai.com/wordpress/time-since][TimeSince plugin for WordPress]]. For example, it was only able to display a time diff with at most two expressions: "1day, 2hours ago" or "1 week ago" but not "1 day, 2 hours and 3 minutes".
It even displays only one time expression if the difference does not occure in two adjacent time units (time units are year, month, week, day, hour, minute). 
If a time interval differs in week and hour the <nop>TimeSince WP plugin will only display the week difference and not the hours as week and hour are not adjacent. This is fixed in the TimeSincePlugin for TWiki. Several other parameters have been added
to give a finer control of the format and the information displayed.

---++ Syntax Rules

=%<nop>TIMESINCE%=,
=%<nop>TIMESINCE{[[from]="..."] [to="..."]}%=

Without arguments the time since the current topic has been created will be displayed.

| *Argument* | *Description* |
| =from="&lt;time-experssion>"= | the starting time point, if ommited the current time |
| =to="&lt;time-expression>"= | the ending timepoint, if ommited the current time |
| =units="1...7"= | number of time units to display, default 2; \
  (example units="3": 2 months, 1 day and 3 minutes) |
| =seconds="on,off"= | switch on/off seconds, default off |
| =minutes="on,off"= | switch on/off minutes |
| =hours="on,off"= | switch on/off hours |
| =days="on,off"= | switch on/off days |
| =weeks="on,off"= | switch on/off weeks |
| =months="on,off"= | switch on/off months |
| =years="on,off"= | switch on/off years |
| =null="&lt;format-string>"= | to be displayed if the tim difference is null; \
   defaults to "about now" |
| =format="&lt;format-string>"= | format of the output, \
  defaults to "$time", other usefull settings =format="$time ago"=, \
  =format="replied $time later"=, ="format="$time after the incident"= |
| =negformat="&lt;format-string>"= | use this format string if the time difference is negative |

Note, that switching off years and months (or any other two adjacent time unites) won't display the correct duration
when the times differ more than a year, that is: years can't be converted to weeks, the next lower unit.
The following units can be converted to each other: 
   * year &lt;=&gt; months
   * weeks &lt;=&gt; days
   * hours &lt;=&gt; minutes

For a further explanation/excuse, read 
[[http://search.cpan.org/~drolsky/DateTime-0.4304/lib/DateTime.pm#How_Datetime_Math_is_Done][how datetime math is done]].

Time expressions can be specified in any of the following format:
   * 31 Dec 2001 - 23:59 (TWiki date)
   * 31 Dec 2001
   * 2001/12/31 23:59:59 (RCS date) %BR%
     also =-=, =.= instead of =/= in date, also =.= instead =:= in time
   * 2001/12/31 23:59
   * 2001/12/31
   * 2001-12-31T23:59:59Z (ISO date)
   * 2001-12-31T23:59:59+01:00
   * 2001-12-31T23:59Z
   * 2001-12-31T23:59+01:00
   * epoch seconds

Format strings may contain the following:
   * =$time= expands to the calculated time difference
   * =$percnt$= expands to a =%= char
   * =$dollar$= expands to a =$= char
   * =$n= expands to a linefeed
   * =$t= expands to a tab space
   * =$nop= expands to the empty string

---++ Examples
| *You type* | *You get (simulated)* | *You get (if installed) *|
| %<nop>TIMESINCE% | 2 years and 6 months | %TIMESINCE% | 
| %<nop>TIMESINCE{format="topic was created $time ago" null="topic has just now been saved" units="3" }% | topic was created 1 day, 3 hours and 8 minutes ago \
| %TIMESINCE{format="topic was created $time ago" null="topic has just now been saved" units="4"}% |
| %<nop>TIMESINCE{"11 Sep 2001 - 8:45" units="7" seconds="on"}% \
| 4 years, 2 months, 2 days, 5 hours, 50 minutes, 16 seconds \
| %TIMESINCE{"11 Sep 2001 - 8:45"  units="7" seconds="on"}% | 
| %<nop>TIMESINCE{from="1955/04/18" to="1979-03-14" units="3"}% | 23 years, 11 months, 6 days \
| %TIMESINCE{from="1955/04/18" to="1979-03-14" units="3"}% |
