---+ Bundled CommandSets

TWikiShellContrib is distributed with some CommandSets aimed at TWiki:Codev.TWikiExtension development.

---++ TWiki::Contrib::CommandSet::Dump

This is a sample CommandSet. Used to dump various debug informations:

| *Command* | *Description* |
| dump | Shows the help for the dump subcommands |
| dump config  | Dumps the config |
| dump handlers | Dumps the registered handlers |

---++ TWiki::Contrib::CommandSet::Apache

Used to manipulate the apache config file that needs to be modified to install twiki (usually the httpd.conf, but can be any file)

| *Command* | *Description* |
| apache | Shows the summary for the apache subcommands |
| apache add  | Adds a TWiki configuration to Apache |
| apache delete | Removes a TWiki configuration from Apache |

---+++ =apache add=

<verbatim>
SYNOPSIS
     apache add <basepath>

DESCRIPTION
      This command will install the current $TWIKI_ROOT
     in the Apache config file specified during TWikiShell 
     configuration. The installed TWiki will be under 
     <basepath>
      It scans the file for the =<IfModule mod_alias.c>= line
     to determine where to put the install information.
     This command creates a tipical *secured* twiki install,
     that is, only bin and pub will be visible from the browser.

EXAMPLE
     twikishell apache add MyTWikiInstall

        Will add the following lines to the Apache config file:

        ##################################BEGIN MyTWikiInstall
        alias /MyTWikiInstall/pub $TWIKI_ROOT/pub

        <Directory "$TWIKI_ROOT/pub">
             AllowOverride All
             Allow From All
        </Directory>

        alias /MyTWikiInstall/bin $TWIKI_ROOT/bin

        <Directory "$TWIKI_ROOT/bin">
             AllowOverride All
             Allow From All
            Options ExecCGI
            SetHandler cgi-script
        </Directory>
        #################################################

        Thus installing $TWIKI_ROOT in the /MyTWikiInstall path

</verbatim>

---+++ =apache delete=

<verbatim>
SYNOPSIS
     apache delete <basepath>

DESCRIPTION
     This command will delete from the Apache config file the install
     created by =apache add= that is pointed by <basepath>.

     It will look for the first line created by the =apache add= subcommand.
     A backup of the original file is made before the changes are applied.

EXAMPLE
     twikishell apache delete MyTWikiInstall

        Will look for the line
            ##################################BEGIN MyTWikiInstall

        and delete that installation.
</verbatim>
