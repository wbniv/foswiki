---+!! TWiki Shell

%TOC%

---+ Purpose
%STARTINCLUDE%
TWikiShellContrib is  a shell that can be use to replace all twiki command line scripts with a single interface. Each command available in the twikishell is also available as a command line option (i.e: to invoke the =help= command, type =twikishell help=)
%STOPINCLUDE%

---+ Usage

In the TWiki home directory, there is an uber-command:
	* twikishell

This will fire the shell. The following command line options are available:

| *Option* | *Description* |
| -v | Verbose mode (Verbosity level 1) (Default) |
| -vv | Very Verbose mode (Verbosity level 2) |
| -q | Quiet Operation (Verbosity level 0) |
| -d | Turns on debugging (prints debug statements to console) |
| &lt;command&gt; | Execute the specified command. Must be the last option in the cli. i.e: twikishell package CalendarPlugin|

---+ Operation

When the shell starts, it first try to load the =.twikirc= file for the stored configuration. If it can't find it, it will create an empty configuration, and is up to each CommandSet to reconfigure themselves.

On a bare installation (without any CommandSets installed), you have the following available commands:

| *Command* | *Description* |
| help | Shows a list of available commands  |
| help <command> | Shows a detailed help of the specified command  |
| help <command> <subcommand> | Shows a detailed help of the specified subcommand  |
| exit, q , quit | Quits the shell |
| import <perl module> | Imports a perl module and scan it for new commands to be added to the shell |
| verbose <level> | Changes the verbosity level to either 1 or 2 |
| quiet | Changes the verbosity level to 0 |
| debug | Set debugging On and Off. Usage: debug [on/off] |

The config file is a dump (using CPAN:Data::Dumper) of the configuration object used internally
