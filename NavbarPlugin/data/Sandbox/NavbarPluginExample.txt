This example topic for the NavbarPlugin is comprised
of 3 parts of a short text of Douglas Adams

What we have to do is put a %<nop>NAVBARINDEX% in this page, and list the subtopics
as items (bullets or numbered, any depth) with the topic name being the first thing after the bullet
(rest is ignored)

<!-- %NAVBARINDEX% (it can be in as HTML comment to hide it) --> 
	1 NavbarPluginExampleFirst, where we start everything
	10 NavbarPluginExampleMiddle for developing ideas
		* NavbarPluginExampleLast conclusions
<!-- %NAVBARINDEXEND% optional marker to ignore further bulleted items -->

On this page (body and/or skin), 
	* %<nop>NAVBAR% is expanded to %NAVBAR%
	* and %<nop>NAVBAR{graphics="on"}% is expanded to %NAVBAR{graphics="on"}%
