---+!! Welcome, %WIKIUSERNAME%!

Welcome to <nop>%WIKITOOLNAME%! This is a TWikiSite (pronounced _twee-kee site_), a meeting place to work on common interests. Anyone can contribute using any web browser. <nop>%WIKITOOLNAME% looks like a normal web site... except that it encourages contribution and *editing* of pages, questions, answers, comments and updates.

"Wiki" systems are fundamentally editable web pages.  It's a fun and useful way of communicating asynchronously over the web for many existing intranet and public Internet sites.  TWiki is simple to learn and use.  It aims to provide a transparent way for you to publish and exchange your ideas with others over the web.
