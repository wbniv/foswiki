Wikis benefits from the fact that every user can modify a topic instantly without restrictions. However sometimes you want to be able to associate a "state" with a topic and then control the work flow that the topic progresses through as content is added. 
For example,
   * When writing documents compliant with ISO 9000 (e.g. a quality manual), it is essential that documents are approved by the management before they may be applied by the employees.
   * In a defect tracking data base, defects typically transition through a series of states from submission to resolution, with different actions available depending on the state of the defect.
   * In a journal database, papers must be reviewed and approved by several experts in the field before being allowed to be published.

This plugin lets you associate a complex work flow with topics in your wiki.

A workflow can be associated with a single topic, or with an entire web. If a topic is under workflow control, you can define a set of _states_ for this topic (e.g. "under revision", "waiting for approval", "approved") and _transitions_ (e.g. "revise", "approve") between these states. Furthermore, you can define which users/groups are permitted to perform specific transistions. In this way, you can control, for example, who is allowed to "approve" a topic and who is not. 

---++ Usage

A topic is under document control if the preference variable =WORKFLOW= is set
in the topic page. =WORKFLOW= must be set to the wiki name of a topic that describes your specific workflow (the _workflow description topic_).

Note: you can hide the setting in a normal view using HTML comments, or better, you can put these settings into the local topic settings, accessible from the "more" screen.

---+++ Settings in the workflow description topic 

The workflow description topic must contain one state table and one transition table. The state table describes the possible states a document may be in (nodes in the flow diagram above), and the transition table describes how documents move between states (arcs in the flow diagram).

This is easiest illustrated using an example (available as Sandbox.DocumentApprovalWorkflow if the plugin is installed).

The state table is a table with three columns:

<verbatim>
| *State*       | *Allow Edit* | *Message* |
| UNDERREVISION | QualityGroup | This document is being revised. |
| APPROVED      | nobody       | This document has been approved for release. |
| WAITINGFORQM  | nobody       | This document is waiting for approval by the Quality Manager. |
| WAITINGFORCTO | nobody       | This document is waiting for approval by the CTO.|
</verbatim>

Each row in the table defines a state where:
	* the *State* column specifies a name for the state, 
	* the *Allow Edit* column specifies who is permitted to edit the topic when it is in the state, and 
	* the *Message* column defines a message which can be displayed on the document page when the document is in this state.

In the example we have defined four states. Members of the
!QualityGroup are permitted modify documents can make changes to the document
in UNDERREVISION state. In all other states, nobody is allowed to edit the
controlled document.

The first state in the table is the initial/default state.

%X% NOTE: The state table must be defined *before* the transition table!

The transition table consists of four columns, as in this example:
<verbatim>
| *State*        | *Action* | *Next State*  | *Allowed*                        | *Form*        |
| APPROVED       | revise   | UNDERREVISION | QualityGroup                     | ApprovedForm  |
| UNDERREVISION  | complete | WAITINGFORQM  | QualityGroup                     | InProcessForm |
| WAITINGFORQM   | approve  | WAITINGFORCTO | QualityManager                   |               |
| WAITINGFORQM   | reject   | UNDERREVISION | QualityManager,QualityGroup      |               |
| WAITINGFORCTO  | approve  | APPROVED      | TechnicalDirector                | ApprovedForm  |
| WAITINGFORCTO  | reject   | UNDERREVISION | TechnicalDirector,QualityManager |               |
</verbatim>

Each row in this table defines a transition from one state to another state:
	* the *State* column contains the name of a state from the state table, 
	* the *Action* column describes a possible action when the topic is in
      this state,
	* the *Next State* column defines the new state of the document after
      the specified action has been performed,
	* the *Allowed* column specifies who is allowed to perform the
      corresponding action,
	* the _optional_ *Form* column defines a form that is attached to
      the topic in this state.

In our example, anyone is allowed to revise the document when it is in =UNDERREVISION= state. After finishing the revision, the document can be transitioned to the =WAITINGFORQM= state by any member of the !QualityGroup. It must then be approved by the !QualityManager, and after that by the !TechnicalDirector. Even though they can't edit the document themselves (see state table above), they _can_ reject the revision and put the document back into the =UNDERREVISION= state. The !TechnicalDirector can transition the document to =APPROVED= state where it rests until a member of the !QualityGroup puts it under revision again.

If a form name is given in the last column, this form will be attached to the topic, and the topic will put in edit mode to allow information to be provided in the form _when that state transition happens_. In the example above, a form of type Approved<nop>Form will be attached to the topic when the CTO transitions the topic into =APPROVED= state.
   * if there is already a form of a different type attached to the topic, then any fields that have the same name in the _new_ form will be preserved.
   * If no form is given, the existing form (if any) is left in place.
A typical usage of the form would be to collect additional information as the topic walks through the work flow, or to make information in the form unchangeable (by setting it to a =label= field) once a given state is reached.

You can also define other variables starting with =WORKFLOW= in the workflow description topic. These will be expanded to their defined values in any topic that uses the workflow. For example:
	* Set WORKFLOWNOTICE = This topic is under document control.
will define =WORKFLOWNOTICE= in any topic that uses the workflow.

---+++ Settings in your controlled document/topic

As described above the topic needs to contain a definition for the variable =WORKFLOW= for it to be controlled under the approval workflow. This is best set as a document-specific preference setting in the =More topic actions= screen.

The plugin defines a number of %SYSTEMWEB%.TWikiVariables that can be used in the topic under flow control:
%INCLUDE{VarWORKFLOW}%

If you replace =%<nop>EDITTOPIC%= with =%<nop>WORKFLOWEDITTOPIC%= in your %SYSTEMWEB%.TWikiTemplates, then the _Edit_ link is crossed out when the user is not allowed to edit the page in a state.  

---++ Reporting
A common requirement is to report on the status of topics that are in different states in the workflow. If you are using TWiki 4.2.0 or later, you can use the query search to search for topics in a specific state. For example, to search for all topics in state "APPROVED":
<verbatim>
%SEARCH{"META:WORKFLOW.name='APPROVED'" type="query"}%
</verbatim>
For more information of query searches, see %SYSTEMWEB%.QuerySearch.

---++ Bugs

	* You can attach a file to a contolled topic even if the state of the topic does not allow the user to edit it. In general, the plugin should prevent any changes to the topic in such case.
	* If a transition attaches a form, the initial values are not taken from the form definition, due to the way the form initialization algorithm works.

---++ History and Acknowledgements

This plugin was motivated by [[TWiki:Main.ThomasWeigert][Thomas Weigert]] 's [[TWiki:Plugins.WorkFlowAddOn][WorkFlowAddOn]] and its first version (then called !ApprovalPlugin) was written by [[TWiki:Main.ThomasHartkens][Thomas Hartkens]], albeit it was focused on document approval and control. [[TWiki:Main.ThomasWeigert][Thomas Weigert]] then merged the functionality of the [[TWiki:Plugins.WorkFlowAddOn][WorkFlowAddOn]] into this plugin. [[TWiki:Main.CrawfordCurrie][Crawford Currie]] enhanced the documentation and installation procedure.

---++ Plugin Settings
Plugin settings are stored as preferences variables. To reference
a plugin setting write ==%<nop>&lt;plugin&gt;_&lt;setting&gt;%==, i.e. ==%<nop>WORKFLOWPLUGIN_SHORTDESCRIPTION%==

   * History format. In this example, the first line tells the plugin to format the history as a bullet list, the second just writes a newline separated list. The variables =$state=, =$wikiusername=, =$date=, =$quot=, and =$n= (or =$n()=) can be used in the format statement, with the same meaning as in TWiki.FormattedSearch.
      * #Set WORKFLOWHISTORYFORMAT = "	* $state -- $wikiusername, $date"
      * Set WORKFLOWHISTORYFORMAT = "$n$state, $wikiusername, $date"

   * Appearance of the button to change state can be configured by providing a CSS class.
      * Set CSSCLASS = twikiChangeFormButton twikiSubmit

---++ Plugin Installation Instructions

%$INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS%

__Note:__ The script =[[%ATTACHURL/convert.pl.txt][convert.pl.txt]]= supplied will convert topics written for the !ApprovalPlugin to the WorkflowPlugin. The script takes a topic at the standard input and outputs the converted topic on standard output. Rename the file from =convert.pl.txt= to =convert.pl=.

Look at the examples in the !Sandbox web.

__Note:__ For strict access control, the plugin should know who is looking at the controlled document/topic at all times.  To enable this, you may want to set up the wiki in such way that users have to log-in *even if they just display a topic*.
