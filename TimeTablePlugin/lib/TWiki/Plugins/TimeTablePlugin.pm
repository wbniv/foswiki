---++ initPlugin($topic, $web, $user, $installWeb) -> $boolean
   * =$topic= - the name of the topic in the current CGI query
   * =$web= - the name of the web in the current CGI query
   * =$user= - the login name of the user
   * =$installWeb= - the name of the web the plugin is installed in

REQUIRED

Called to initialise the plugin. If everything is OK, should return
a non-zero value. On non-fatal failure, should write a message
using TWiki::Func::writeWarning and return 0. In this case
%FAILEDPLUGINS% will indicate which plugins failed.

In the case of a catastrophic failure that will prevent the whole
installation from working safely, this handler may use 'die', which
will be trapped and reported in the browser.

You may also call =TWiki::Func::registerTagHandler= here to register
a function to handle tags that have standard TWiki syntax - for example,
=%MYTAG{"my param" myarg="My Arg"}%. You can also override internal
TWiki tag handling functions this way, though this practice is unsupported
and highly dangerous!

---++ earlyInitPlugin()

is called before any other handler.

If it returns a non-null error string, the plugin will be disabled.

Allows a plugin to set the username, for example based on cookies.

Return the user name, or =guest= if not logged in.

This handler is called very early, immediately after =earlyInitPlugin=.

   * =$text= - text to be processed
   * =$topic= - the name of the topic in the current CGI query
   * =$web= - the name of the web in the current CGI query
This handler is called by the code that expands %TAGS% syntax in
the topic body and in form fields. It may be called many times while
a topic is being rendered.

Plugins that want to implement their own %TAGS% with non-trivial
additional syntax should implement this function. Internal TWiki
tags (and any tags declared using =TWiki::Func::registerTagHandler=)
are expanded _before_, and then again _after_, this function is called
to ensure all %TAGS% are expanded.

For tags with trivial syntax it is far more efficient to use
=TWiki::Func::registerTagHandler= (see =initPlugin=).

__NOTE:__ when this handler is called, &lt;verbatim> blocks have been
removed from the text (though all other HTML such as &lt;pre> blocks is
still present).

__NOTE:__ meta-data is _not_ embedded in the text passed to this
handler.

   * =$text= - text to be processed

This handler is called before TWiki does any expansion of it's own
internal tags. It is designed for use by cache plugins. Note that
when this handler is called, &lt;verbatim> blocks are still present
in the text.

__NOTE__: This handler is called once for each call to

rendering of a topic.

This handler is after TWiki has completed expansion of %TAGS%.
It is designed for use by cache plugins. Note that when this handler
is called, &lt;verbatim> blocks are present in the text.

__NOTE__: This handler is called once for each call to

---++ preRenderingHandler( $text, \%map )
   * =$text= - text, with the head, verbatim and pre blocks replaced with placeholders
   * =\%removed= - reference to a hash that maps the placeholders to the removed blocks.

Handler called immediately before TWiki syntax structures (such as lists) are
processed, but after all variables have been expanded. Use this handler to process special syntax only recognised by your plugin.

Placeholders are text strings constructed using the tag name and a sequence number e.g. 'pre1', "verbatim6", "head1" etc. Placeholders are inserted into the text inside &lt;!--!marker!--&gt; characters so the text will contain &lt;!--!pre1!--&gt; for placeholder pre1.

Each removed block is represented by the block text and the parameters passed to the tag (usually empty) e.g. for
<verbatim>
<pre class='slobadob'>
XYZ
</pre>
the map will contain:
<pre>
$removed->{'pre1'}{text}:   XYZ
$removed->{'pre1'}{params}: class="slobadob"
</pre>
Iterating over blocks for a single tag is easy. For example, to prepend a line number to every line of every pre block you might use this code:
<verbatim>
foreach my $placeholder ( keys %$map ) {
    if( $placeholder =~ /^pre/i ) {
       my $n = 1;
       $map->{$placeholder}{text} =~ s/^/$n++/gem;
    }
}
</verbatim>

__NOTE__: This handler is called once for each rendered block of text i.e. it may be called several times during the rendering of a topic.

__NOTE:__ meta-data is _not_ embedded in the text passed to this
handler.

---++ mergeHandler( $diff, $old, $new, \%info ) -> $text
Try to resolve a difference encountered during merge. The =differences= array is an array of hash references, where each hash contains the following fields:
   * =$diff= => one of the characters '+', '-', 'c' or ' '.
      * '+' - =new= contains text inserted in the new version
      * '-' - =old= contains text deleted from the old version
      * 'c' - =old= contains text from the old version, and =new= text from the version being saved
      * ' ' - =new= contains text common to both versions, or the change only involved whitespace
   * =$old= => text from version currently saved
   * =$new= => text from version being saved
   * =\%info= is a reference to the form field description { name, title, type, size, value, tooltip, attributes, referenced }. It must _not_ be wrtten to. This parameter will be undef when merging the body text of the topic.

Plugins should try to resolve differences and return the merged text. For example, a radio button field where we have ={ diff=>'c', old=>'Leafy', new=>'Barky' }= might be resolved as ='Treelike'=. If the plugin cannot resolve a difference it should return undef.

The merge handler will be called several times during a save; once for each difference that needs resolution.

If any merges are left unresolved after all plugins have been given a chance to intercede, the following algorithm is used to decide how to merge the data:
   1 =new= is taken for all =radio=, =checkbox= and =select= fields to resolve 'c' conflicts
   1 '+' and '-' text is always included in the the body text and text fields
   1 <del>conflict</del> <ins>markers</ins> are used to mark 'c' merges in text fields

The merge handler is called whenever a topic is saved, and a merge is required to resolve concurrent edits on a topic.

---++ modifyHeaderHandler( \%headers, $query )
   * =\%headers= - reference to a hash of existing header values

proposed by the core, plus any modifications made by other plugins that also
implement this method that come earlier in the plugins list.
<verbatim>
$headers->{expires} = '+1h';

Note that this is the HTTP header which is _not_ the same as the HTML
&lt;HEAD&gt; tag. The contents of the &lt;HEAD&gt; tag may be manipulated
using the =TWiki::Func::addToHEAD= method.
