---+ <nop>LaTeX to <nop>MathML Mathematical Equation Plug-in

This plugin translates embedded <nop>LaTeX-like equations into in-line <nop>MathML.
It requires a <nop>MathML enabled browser, such as Mozilla.

---++ Syntax Rules

The syntax rules for embedding equations are identical to those of the
TWiki:Plugins/MathModePlugin and are based on <nop>LaTeX's own markup 
for equations.  The equations themselves are expressed in a language
very, very similar to <nop>LaTeX called
[[http://pear.math.pitt.edu/mathzilla/itex2mmlItex.html][Itex]].
(Apparently the major differences are in the way equation arrays are
handled.)

To put an equation in-line with your text, enclose it with percent signs and
the dollar sign, 
<pre>
	%$ put your math here $%
</pre>
for example:
<pre>
	%$  \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = U(x) $%
</pre>
where the opening and closing delimiter must be on the same line.

For equations set on their own line, use the 
<pre>
	%\[ put your math here \]%
</pre>
notation, for example:
<pre>
	%\[  \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = U(x) \]%
</pre>
and the font will be slightly larger.

For equations written over several lines in the original TWiki document
you use the =<verbatim>%MATH<nop>MODE{ "a=b" }%</verbatim>=
delimiter.  The value in quotes is type set, whether or not it is on
a single line.  However, unlike the other delimiters, this is also
typeset in &lt;pre&gt; environments.

---++ Examples

%$ \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n} $% is divergent, but %$ \lim_{n \to \infty}\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{i} - \ln n $% exists.

This is an %$\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = U(x)$% inline equation.

This equation %\[\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \pi \int_a^b F(x) dx\]% should be typset
on its own line.

This equation %MATHMODE{"
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 
			 \omega \int_a^b F(x) dx
"}%
is broken over several lines of source text.

---++ Resources for <nop>MathML

	* [[http://www.mozilla.org/projects/mathml/][Mozilla's <nop>MathML Project]]
		contains information on how to get started with <nop>MathML in Mozilla.
		A default installation from a major Linux distribution ought to be
		complete enough to use this plug-in.  It is available for free.
		_See notes below._
	* The [[http://pear.math.pitt.edu/mathzilla/itex2mml.html][itex2MML]]
		program is a [[http://www.gnu.org/directory/flex.html][FLEX/LEX]]
		parser which this plug-in uses to do the actual translation of the
		<nop>LaTeX equations into <nop>MathML.
	* At the [[http://www.w3.org/Math/][W3C Math Home Page]] you can find the DTD for
	  <nop>MathML along with authoring information.  You can even read the 1993 proposal
	  neglected for so many years.  Advocates of the commercialization of the web:
	  please note the delay and feel __shame__.
	* If your organisation does not allow Mozilla then there is a plug-in available
	  at [[http://www.dessci.com/en/products/webeq/webeq.asp][Design Science]] which
	  may do the trick. _(I haven't tried this one.)_


---++ <nop>%TOPIC% Global Settings

Plugin settings are stored as preferences variables. To reference a plugin setting write ==%<nop>&lt;plugin&gt;_&lt;setting&gt;%==, i.e. ==%<nop>INTERWIKIPLUGIN_SHORTDESCRIPTION%==

	* One line description, is shown in the %SYSTEMWEB%.TextFormattingRules topic:
		* Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Display <nop>LaTeX-like equations in-line using <nop>MathML

	* Debug plugin: (See output in =data/debug.txt=)
		* Set DEBUG = 0

---++ Plugin Installation Instructions

__Note:__ You do not need to install anything on the browser to use this
plugin (although your browser must be capable of displaying <nop>MathML).  The
following instructions are for the administrator who installs the plugin on the
server where TWiki is running. 

	* Install the program
	  [[http://pear.math.pitt.edu/mathzilla/itex2mml.html][itex2MML]] on your
	  system.  The location must be somewhere that your web server can access.

	* If you have it installed, disable the TWiki:Plugins/MathModePlugin by
	 adding it to the =DISABLEDPLUGINS= line of your [[%LOCALSITEPREFS%]]
	 page.  For example:%BR%
		* Set DISABLEDPLUGINS = <nop>MathModePlugin 

	* Alter the main =twiki.tmpl= template in the TWiki installation, in the
		=./templates= directory, or in the sub-directory of any Web that will
		use this plugin.  The line
		<pre> &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"&gt; </pre>
		must be changed to support the <nop>MathML DTD.  Over-write it with:
		<pre> &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1 plus <nop>MathML 2.0//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/dtd/xhtml-math11-f.dtd"&gt; </pre>

	* Alter the =lib/TWiki.pm= file so that the content type is emitted not
		as =text/html= but rather =application/xhtml+xml= .  *This is a rather*
		__dire__ *change.*  If you have done anything on your pages that is not
		legal XHTML then your browser may complain mightily.
		<p></p> The change is in =sub writeHeader= about line 505, where
		the statement 
		<pre> writeHeaderFull( $query, 'basic', 'text/html', 0);</pre>
		needs to become 
		<pre> writeHeaderFull( $query, 'basic', 'application/xhtml+xml', 0);</pre>

	* Download the ZIP file from the Plugin web (see below)

	* Unzip ==%TOPIC%.zip== in your twiki installation directory. Content:
	  <p></p>
	  | *File:* | *Description:* |
	  | ==data/TWiki/%TOPIC%.txt== | Plugin topic |
	  | ==data/TWiki/%TOPIC%.txt,v== | Plugin topic repository |
	  | ==pub/TWiki/%TOPIC%/xhtml-math11-f.dtd== | XML DTD for XHTML 1.1 and <nop>MathML |
	  | ==lib/TWiki/Plugins/%TOPIC%.pm== | Plugin Perl module |
	* (Dakar) Visit =configure= in your TWiki installation, and enable the plugin in the {Plugins} section.

	* If your system does not have =itex2MML= on the default path, edit
	  the line of =%TOPIC%.pm= that reads:
	 <pre> my $itex2MML = 'itex2MML'; </pre> 
	 to contain the whole path to the executable.  For example:
	 <pre> my $itex2MML = '/usr/local/bin/itex2MML';</pre>
	* Test if the installation was successful: the examples above should be
		rendered as equations, not text.

---+++ Notes

	1. This plug-in conflicts with the TWiki:Plugins/MathModePlugin 
		which will need to be disabled.  If you re-enable it later, you may need
		to re-edit pages to update any graphics of math that it would have
		otherwise generated.  You may wish to clean-up the graphics left by
		TWiki:Plugins/MathModePlugin in the =pub/= directories.
	<p></p>
	3. Note that documents must be served to Mozilla as =application/xhtml+xml= for the
	  <nop>MathML portion to be rendered correctly.  This can pose some challenges for
	  existing TWiki installations with less than tidy XHTML.
	<p></p>
	3. Mozilla on Linux has a problem with Xft, the <nop>FreeType renderer for fonts.
	  This in turn causes problems with =xfs=, the X11 font server that uses Xft.
	  For Mozilla versions before 1.4 (assuming this gets fixed in 1.4) you have to
	  set the environment variable <pre>  setenv GDK_USE_XFT 0 </pre> to enable
	  the correct rendering of the <nop>TeX Computer Modern fonts.  You may also need to
	  install those fonts, as noted on the
	  [[http://www.mozilla.org/projects/mathml/fonts][<nop>MathML project fonts page.]]
