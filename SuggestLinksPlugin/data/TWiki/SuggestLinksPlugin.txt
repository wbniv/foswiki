*A plugin that suggests you where you are probably forgetting to add a link*

This plugin *for each topic name* of this web:
	* splits the topic name in words
	* remove stopwords (single letters, "an", "the", "and")
	* drops too long topic names (max 4 words, i.e. 24 permutations)
	* tries to find plurals
	* computes all permutations of the words
	* looks for the above sequences of words separated by at most two words

*TODO:* 
	* re-do the =preview= templates using skins and appropriate API handlers
	* add a set of _stopTopics_ ... topics we don't want to link to (Web Home, Web Preferences ...)

*Settings*
	* Short description of this Plugin (this appears in [[TWiki.Plugins]] only if you enable it with ==suggestions=on==)
		* Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Automatically highlights group of words that *could* become a link
	* Stopwords to ignore (single letters are always ignored):
		* Set STOPWORDS = an, and, the, to, for
	* You can choose the way the found text should be highlighted by setting the format to be
	  applied before (FORMAT1) and after (FORMAT2) the text found.
	  ==$topic== stands for the topic name suggested, ==$web== for the web you selected.
		* Example that just uses a different highlight color:
			* #Set FORMAT1 = <SPAN STYLE='background : #FFCAFF;'>
			* #Set FORMAT2 = </SPAN><img src="%PUBURLPATH%/Plugins/SuggestLinksPlugin/exclam.gif" alt="$web.$topic">
		* Example that just links to the found topic: (remove the # to enable)
			* #Set FORMAT1 = "prima $web.$topic]["
			* #Set FORMAT2 = "dopo"


*Usage Example*
| *you type* | *you get* | *if correctly installed* |
| Example of a plugin <nop> that suggests topic links found in text | Example of a <SPAN STYLE='background : #FFFFCE;'>plugin that suggests topic links</SPAN><img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/exclam.gif" alt="%WEB%.%TOPIC%"> found in text | Example of a plugin that suggests topic links found in text | 

*Istallation*
	* Install the *List::Permutor* Perl package (see http://www.cpan.org).
	* Unzip the *%TOPIC%<nop>.zip* package in your TWiki installation directory.
	* When you want to see suggestions add the URL parameters: 
		* ==suggestions=on==
		* ==suggestionsWeb=TWiki==  this is the web you want to get the links from (default: the current web)
		* ==suggestionsLength=3==	(default: patterns of no more than *4* words -- max limit = *6* i.e. 240 permutations per topic) 
	* I add an example of template that allows you to enable suggestions during preview
		* it's called ==edit.suggest.tmpl==
		* to use it set SKIN=suggest (or add ==skin=suggest== to the URL)

If the installation is correct you should see the words "plugin that suggests topic links" above, highlighted
and with an icon showing the ALT="%WEB%.%TOPIC%" string.
