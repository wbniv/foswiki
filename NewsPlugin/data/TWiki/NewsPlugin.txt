---+!! %TOPIC% v1.5

The News plugin implements a simple "Headlines" view, or summary, of a list of
news or a weblog.   Add a =%<nop>NEWS%= variable in a news topic named *Xxx*
to generate a headline topic named *Xxx<nop>Headlines*.

%TOC%

---++ Syntax Rules

One enters news as items of a bulleted list in a single source topic, most
recent first. If somewhere in the topic, the keyword ==%<nop>NEWS%== appears,
then a new topic is created with the first line of the most recent news.
Ending punctuation is removed from the headlines for a sleeker look.

Recommended usage is to =%<nop>INCLUDE%= the generated topic in some panel in
a front page, and put a "More..." link in it to the source topic.  The
=%<nop>NEWS%= variable can be set in an HTML comment to hide it in the source
topic: 

=&lt;!-- %<nop>NEWS% -->=

To change the default, use the syntax =%<nop>NEWS{parameter="value" ...}%= syntax
with the following available parameters:
| *Parameter* | *Value* |
| count | The number of headlines to keep. Defaults to 5. |
| pattern | Gives a (partial) regular expression pattern to use to extract the news items. This pattern must occur at the beginning of a line in order to select a news item. The headline then becomes everything following the pattern until the end of the line. Defaults to =(\t&#124;   )\*\s= (i.e., a first-level bullet). \
<!-- Note that the pattern is given using the HTML entity for the vertical bar in order to avoid it being interpreted as a column marker in the table.--> |
| postsep | Appends this text to each headline. Defaults to =newline= |
| prefix | This text will be prepended to the generated topic. Defaults to nothing. |
| presep | Prepend each headline with this text. Defaults to =&lt;tab>*&lt;space>= |
| suffix | This text will be appended to the generated topic. Defaults to nothing. |
| topic | Name of generated headlines topic. Defaults to the name of the source topic with =Headlines= appended to it. |
| trim | If set to "no", trailings punctuation marks ( =.,:;= ) are not removed from headlines. Defaults to "yes" |

---++ Examples

Example: Set the prefix, presep, and suffix to produce an HTML unordered (bullet) list:
=%<nop>NEWS{presep="&lt;li>" prefix="&lt;ul>" suffix="&lt;/ul>"}%=

Example: If the topic <tt>MyCompanyNews</tt> contains:
<pre style='background:#ffffe0; border:solid; width=80%; border-width: thin;'>
%<nop>NEWS%
   <nop>* NewsPlugin released - 18 Feb 2003.
   The great news plugin has been debugged
   <nop>* NewsPlugin devel started - 02 Jan 2003.
   I think this is really needed, 
   I will try to keep it simple
</pre>
Then on saving the topic <tt>MyCompanyNewsHeadlines</tt> will contain:
<pre style='background:#ffffe0; border:solid; width=80%; border-width: thin;''>
   <nop>* NewsPlugin released - 18 Feb 2003
   <nop>* NewsPlugin devel started - 02 Jan 2003
</pre>

Example: This is the same example above, except the news headlines are specified as level-2 headings:
<pre style='background:#ffffe0; border:solid; width=80%; border-width: thin;'>
%<nop>NEWS{pattern="---\+\+(!!)?"}%
