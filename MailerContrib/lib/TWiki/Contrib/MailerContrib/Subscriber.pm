---+ package TWiki::Contrib::MailerContrib::Subscriber
Object that represents a subscriber to notification. A subscriber is
a name (which may be a wikiName or an email address) and a list of
subscriptions which describe the topis subscribed to, and
unsubscriptions representing topics they are specifically not
interested in. The subscriber
name may also be a group, so it may expand to many email addresses.
