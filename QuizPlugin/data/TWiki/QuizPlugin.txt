%TOC%

One of the things that training design people tell us is that "it's good to checkpoint" during a training course with quiz questions. This is a little quiz formatter that lets us embed a quiz into the training in the wiki, as we develop it. Of course, you can use it for other things as well....

The sort of quizzes we need are simple; multiple choice, or questions answerable with a single string. This plugin allows us to design such simple quizzes in a TWiki topic (these are just examples; they don't work):

=%<nop>QUIZ{"Why is the sea boiling hot?" type="select" choices="It isn't;Just because;42" correct="Just because"}%=

<div class='twikiAlert'> Q1: Why is the sea boiling hot?</div>
<input type='radio' name='field' value='It isn't'> It isn't <br />
<input type='radio' name='field' value='Just because'> Just because <br />
<input type='radio' name='field' value='42'> 42 <br />

<input type=button value="Submit Answer" onClick="Submit1()">
<input type=button value="Show Solutions" onClick="Cheat1()">
<p />
=%<nop>QUIZ{"Which of the following are English Counties?" type="select" choices="Peckham;Cheshire;Argyll;Wisconsin;Cornwall" correct="Cheshire;Cornwall"}%=

<div class='twikiAlert'> Q2: Which of the following are English Counties?</div>
<input type='checkbox' name='field' value='Peckham'> Peckham <br />
<input type='checkbox' name='field' value='Cheshire'> Cheshire <br />
<input type='checkbox' name='field' value='Argyll'> Argyll <br />
<input type='checkbox' name='field' value='Wisconsin'> Wisconsin <br />
<input type='checkbox' name='field' value='Cornwall'> Cornwall <br />

<input type=button value="Submit Answer" onClick="Submit2()">
<input type=button value="Show Solutions" onClick="Cheat2()">
<p />
=%<nop>QUIZ{"How long is a yard?" type="string" correct="3.5 pints" jump="TWikiAccessControl"}%=
<div class='twikiAlert'> Q3: How long is a yard?</div>
<input type='text' name='field' size='9' maxlength='9'>  <br />
</td></tr></table><input type=button value="Submit" onClick="Submit3()">
<input type=button value="Show Solutions" onClick="Cheat3()">
